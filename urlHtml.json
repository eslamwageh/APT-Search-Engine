A few more adjustments have been made withe following patches: v9.1.0337 and 9.1.345. That means, you can now place your configuration files under ~/.config/vim/ instead of ~/.vim so Vim will stop littering your home directory. Note: To make this change backwards compatible, Vim will only attempt to source from that location, if ~/.vim/vimrc and ~/.vimrc file do not exist. So it won\u0027t impact existing users, but users that want to start using the new location, will need to move their existing configuration to the new place. You can also read about it at :h xdg-base-dir. Thanks to all the contributors that help Vim continuing to grow!

This release is dedicated to Bram Moolenaar, Vims lead developer for more than 30 years, who suddenly passed away in August 2023. The most notable changes are support for Vim9 classes and objects, smooth scrolling support and virtual text support. And as usual, runtime files have been updated, many bugs have been fixed and potential security relevant fixes have been included. You can find the full announcement here.

The big O notation is used to represent an algorithm\u0027s time complexity. The asymptotic notation for describing time complexity, in this case, is big O notation. The time complexity is calculated primarily by counting the number of steps required to complete the execution. Let us look at an example of time complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emul \u003d 1;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e// Suppose you have to calculate the multiplication of n numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor i\u003d1 to n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emul \u003d mul *1;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e// when the loop ends, then mul holds the multiplication of the n numbers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereturn mul;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time complexity of the loop statement in the preceding code is at least n, and as the value of n escalates, so does the time complexity. While the code\u0027s complexity, i.e., returns mul, will be constant because its value is not dependent on the importance of n and will provide the result in a single step. The worst-time complexity is generally considered because it is the maximum time required for any given input size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe amount of space an algorithm requires to solve a problem and produce an output is called its space complexity. Space complexity, like time complexity, is expressed in big O notation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe space is required for an algorithm for the following reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpace Complexity \u003d Auxiliary Space + Input Size\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally after understanding what is an algorithm, its analysis and approches, you will look at different types of algorithms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis table compares various courses offered by Simplilearn, based on several key features and details.

It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto in Japan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, Java, and Lisp.[10][3]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatsumoto has said that Ruby was conceived in 1993. In a 1999 post to the ruby-talk mailing list, he describes some of his early ideas about the language:[11]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn\u0027t like it really, because it had the smell of a toy language (it still has). The object-oriented language seemed very promising. I knew Python then. But I didn\u0027t like it, because I didn\u0027t think it was a true object-oriented language â OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn\u0027t find one. So I decided to make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl.[12] He praised the language for its ingenuity and creativity for its solution for compiling intervals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name \"Ruby\" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language.[13] Initially two names were proposed: \"Coral\" and \"Ruby\". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka.[14] Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name \"Ruby\"âit was the birthstone of one of his colleagues.[15][16]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on December 21, 1995.[17][18] Subsequently, three more versions of Ruby were released in two days.[13] The release coincided with the launch of the Japanese-language ruby-list mailing list, which was the first mailing list for the new language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready present at this stage of development were many of the features familiar in later releases of Ruby, including object-oriented design, classes with inheritance, mixins, iterators, closures, exception handling and garbage collection.[19]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the release of Ruby 0.95 in 1995, several stable versions of Ruby were released in these years:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1997, the first article about Ruby was published on the Web. In the same year, Matsumoto was hired by netlab.jp to work on Ruby as a full-time developer.[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1998, the Ruby Application Archive was launched by Matsumoto, along with a simple English-language homepage for Ruby.[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1999, the first English language mailing list ruby-talk began, which signaled a growing interest in the language outside Japan.[20] In this same year, Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka wrote the first book on Ruby, The Object-oriented Scripting Language Ruby (ãªãã¸ã§ã¯ãæåã¹ã¯ãªããè¨èª Ruby), which was published in Japan in October 1999. It would be followed in the early 2000s by around 20 books on Ruby published in Japanese.[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy 2000, Ruby was more popular than Python in Japan.[21] In September 2000, the first English language book Programming Ruby was printed, which was later freely released to the public, further widening the adoption of Ruby amongst English speakers. In early 2002, the English-language ruby-talk mailing list was receiving more messages than the Japanese-language ruby-list, demonstrating Ruby\u0027s increasing popularity in the non-Japanese speaking world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 1.8 was initially released August 2003, was stable for a long time, and was retired June 2013.[22] Although deprecated, there is still code based on it. Ruby 1.8 is only partially compatible with Ruby 1.9.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 1.8 has been the subject of several industry standards. The language specifications for Ruby were developed by the Open Standards Promotion Center of the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (a Japanese government agency) for submission to the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JISC) and then to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It was accepted as a Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS X 3017) in 2011[23] and an international standard (ISO/IEC 30170) in 2012.[24][25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround 2005, interest in the Ruby language surged in tandem with Ruby on Rails, a web framework written in Ruby. Rails is frequently credited with increasing awareness of Ruby.[26]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEffective with Ruby 1.9.3, released October 31, 2011,[27] Ruby switched from being dual-licensed under the Ruby License and the GPL to being dual-licensed under the Ruby License and the two-clause BSD license.[28] Adoption of 1.9 was slowed by changes from 1.8 that required many popular third party gems to be rewritten. Ruby 1.9 introduces many significant changes over the 1.8 series. Examples include:[29]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 2.0 was intended to be fully backward compatible with Ruby 1.9.3. As of the official 2.0.0 release on February 24, 2013, there were only five known (minor) incompatibilities.[30] Ruby 2.0 added several new features, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting with 2.1.0, Ruby\u0027s versioning policy changed to be more similar to semantic versioning.[32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 2.2.0 includes speed-ups, bugfixes, and library updates and removes some deprecated APIs. Most notably, Ruby 2.2.0 introduces changes to memory handling â an incremental garbage collector, support for garbage collection of symbols and the option to compile directly against jemalloc. It also contains experimental support for using vfork(2) with system() and spawn(), and added support for the Unicode 7.0 specification. Since version 2.2.1,[33] Ruby MRI performance on PowerPC64 was improved.[34][35][36] Features that were made obsolete or removed include callcc, the DL library, Digest::HMAC, lib/rational.rb, lib/complex.rb, GServer, Logger::Application as well as various C API functions.[37]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 2.3.0 includes many performance improvements, updates, and bugfixes including changes to Proc#call, Socket and IO use of exception keywords, Thread#name handling, default passive Net::FTP connections, and Rake being removed from stdlib.[38] Other notable changes include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 2.4.0 includes performance improvements to hash table, Array#max, Array#min, and instance variable access.[40] Other notable changes include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few notable changes in Ruby 2.5.0 include rescue and ensure statements automatically use a surrounding do-end block (less need for extra begin-end blocks), method-chaining with yield_self, support for branch coverage and method coverage measurement, and easier Hash transformations with Hash#slice and Hash#transform_keys On top of that come a lot of performance improvements like faster block passing (3 times faster), faster Mutexes, faster ERB templates and improvements on some concatenation methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few notable changes in Ruby 2.6.0 include an experimental just-in-time compiler (JIT), and RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree (experimental).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few notable changes in Ruby 2.7.0 include pattern Matching (experimental), REPL improvements, a compaction GC, and separation of positional and keyword arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 3.0.0 was released on Christmas Day in 2020.[41] It is known as Ruby 3x3 which means that programs would run three times faster in Ruby 3.0 comparing to Ruby 2.0.[42] and some had already implemented in intermediate releases on the road from 2 to 3. To achieve 3x3, Ruby 3 comes with MJIT, and later YJIT, Just-In-Time Compilers, to make programs faster, although they are described as experimental and remain disabled by default (enabled by flags at runtime).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother goal of Ruby 3.0 is to improve concurrency and two more utilities Fibre Scheduler, and experimental Ractor facilitate the goal.[41] Ractor is light-weight and thread-safe as it is achieved by exchanging messages rather than shared objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 3.0 introduces RBS language to describe the types of Ruby programs for static analysis.[41] It is separated from general Ruby programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some syntax enhancements and library changes in Ruby 3.0 as well.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 3.1 was released on Christmas Day in 2021.[43] It includes YJIT, a new, experimental, Just-In-Time Compiler developed by Shopify, to enhance the performance of real world business applications. A new debugger is also included. There are some syntax enhancements and other improvements in this release. Network libraries for FTP, SMTP, IMAP, and POP are moved from default gems to bundled gems.[44]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 3.2 was released on Christmas Day in 2022.[45] It brings support for being run inside of a WebAssembly environment via a WASI interface. Regular expressions also receives some improvements, including a faster, memoized matching algorithm to protect against certain ReDoS attacks, and configurable timeouts for regular expression matching. Additional debugging and syntax features are also included in this release, which include syntax suggestion, as well as error highlighting. The MJIT compiler has been re-implemented as a standard library module, while the YJIT, a Rust-based JIT compiler now supports more architectures on Linux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby 3.3 was released on December 25, 2023.[1] Ruby 3.3 introduces significant enhancements and performance improvements to the language. Key features include the introduction of the Prism parser for portable and maintainable parsing, the addition of the pure-Ruby JIT compiler RJIT, and major performance boosts in the YJIT compiler. Additionally, improvements in memory usage, the introduction of an M:N thread scheduler, and updates to the standard library contribute to a more efficient and developer-friendly Ruby ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatsumoto has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good user interface design.[46] At a Google Tech Talk in 2008 he said, \"I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.\"[47] He stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human, rather than computer, needs:[48]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, \"By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something.\" They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatsumoto has said his primary design goal was to make a language that he himself enjoyed using, by minimizing programmer work and possible confusion. He has said that he had not applied the principle of least astonishment (POLA) to the design of Ruby;[48] in a May 2005 discussion on the newsgroup comp.lang.ruby, Matsumoto attempted to distance Ruby from POLA, explaining that because any design choice will be surprising to someone, he uses a personal standard in evaluating surprise. If that personal standard remains consistent, there would be few surprises for those familiar with the standard.[49]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatsumoto defined it this way in an interview:[48]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, \u0027I was surprised by this feature of the language, so Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.\u0027 Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only. The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise. And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well. For example, I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby. I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. And after two years of C++ programming, it still surprises me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby is object-oriented: every value is an object, including classes and instances of types that many other languages designate as primitives (such as integers, booleans, and \"null\"). Because everything in Ruby is an object, everything in Ruby has certain built-in abilities called methods. Every function is a method and methods are always called on an object. Methods defined at the top level scope become methods of the Object class. Since this class is an ancestor of every other class, such methods can be called on any object. They are also visible in all scopes, effectively serving as \"global\" procedures. Ruby supports inheritance with dynamic dispatch, mixins and singleton methods (belonging to, and defined for, a single instance rather than being defined on the class). Though Ruby does not support multiple inheritance, classes can import modules as mixins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby has been described as a multi-paradigm programming language: it allows procedural programming (defining functions/variables outside classes makes them part of the root, \u0027self\u0027 Object), with object orientation (everything is an object) or functional programming (it has anonymous functions, closures, and continuations; statements all have values, and functions return the last evaluation). It has support for introspection, reflective programming, metaprogramming, and interpreter-based threads. Ruby features dynamic typing, and supports parametric polymorphism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Ruby FAQ, the syntax is similar to Perl\u0027s and the semantics are similar to Smalltalk\u0027s, but the design philosophy differs greatly from Python\u0027s.[50]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe syntax of Ruby is broadly similar to that of Perl and Python. Class and method definitions are signaled by keywords, whereas code blocks can be defined by either keywords or braces. In contrast to Perl, variables are not obligatorily prefixed with a sigil. When used, the sigil changes the semantics of scope of the variable. For practical purposes there is no distinction between expressions and statements.[58][59] Line breaks are significant and taken as the end of a statement; a semicolon may be equivalently used. Unlike Python, indentation is not significant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the differences from Python and Perl is that Ruby keeps all of its instance variables completely private to the class and only exposes them through accessor methods (attr_writer, attr_reader, etc.). Unlike the \"getter\" and \"setter\" methods of other languages like C++ or Java, accessor methods in Ruby can be created with a single line of code via metaprogramming; however, accessor methods can also be created in the traditional fashion of C++ and Java. As invocation of these methods does not require the use of parentheses, it is trivial to change an instance variable into a full function, without modifying a single line of calling code or having to do any refactoring achieving similar functionality to C# and VB.NET property members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython\u0027s property descriptors are similar, but come with a trade-off in the development process. If one begins in Python by using a publicly exposed instance variable, and later changes the implementation to use a private instance variable exposed through a property descriptor, code internal to the class may need to be adjusted to use the private variable rather than the public property. Ruby\u0027s design forces all instance variables to be private, but also provides a simple way to declare set and get methods. This is in keeping with the idea that in Ruby, one never directly accesses the internal members of a class from outside the class; rather, one passes a message to the class and receives a response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original Ruby interpreter is often referred to as Matz\u0027s Ruby Interpreter or MRI. This implementation is written in C and uses its own Ruby-specific virtual machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe standardized and retired Ruby 1.8 implementation was written in C, as a single-pass interpreted language.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting with Ruby 1.9, and continuing with Ruby 2.x and above, the official Ruby interpreter has been YARV (\"Yet Another Ruby VM\"), and this implementation has superseded the slower virtual machine used in previous releases of MRI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of 2018[update], there are a number of alternative implementations of Ruby, including JRuby, Rubinius, and mruby. Each takes a different approach, with JRuby and Rubinius providing just-in-time compilation and mruby also providing ahead-of-time compilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby has three major alternative implementations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther Ruby implementations include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther now defunct Ruby implementations were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maturity of Ruby implementations tends to be measured by their ability to run the Ruby on Rails (Rails) framework, because it is complex to implement and uses many Ruby-specific features. The point when a particular implementation achieves this goal is called \"the Rails singularity\". The reference implementation, JRuby, and Rubinius[61] are all able to run Rails unmodified in a production environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatsumoto originally developed Ruby on the 4.3BSD-based Sony NEWS-OS 3.x, but later migrated his work to SunOS 4.x, and finally to Linux.[62][63] By 1999, Ruby was known to work across many different operating systems. Modern Ruby versions and implementations are available on all major desktop, mobile and server-based operating systems. Ruby is also supported across a number of cloud hosting platforms like Jelastic, Heroku, Google Cloud Platform and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTools such as RVM and RBEnv, facilitate installation and partitioning of multiple ruby versions, and multiple \u0027gemsets\u0027 on one machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubyGems is Ruby\u0027s package manager. A Ruby package is called a \"gem\" and can be installed via the command line. Most gems are libraries, though a few exist that are applications, such as IDEs.[64] There are over 100,000 Ruby gems hosted on RubyGems.org.[65]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany new and existing Ruby libraries are hosted on GitHub, a service that offers version control repository hosting for Git.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ruby Application Archive, which hosted applications, documentation, and libraries for Ruby programming, was maintained until 2013, when its function was transferred to RubyGems.[66]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/","html":"\u003cp\u003eHello fellow programs!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etl;dr some revisions to the rules to reduce low quality blogspam.

This isn\u0027t a huge problem yet but I predict that it will be as the percentage of career content is growing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all of these cases the category is more of a tell that the quality is probably low, so exceptions will be made where that\u0027s not the case. These are difficult categories to moderate by so I\u0027ll probably make some mistakes on the boundaries and that\u0027s okay, let me know and we\u0027ll figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome other categories that I\u0027m keeping an eye on but not ruling on today are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorporate blogs simply describing their product in the guise of \"what is an authorisation framework?\" (I\u0027m looking at you Auth0 and others like it). Pretty much anything with a rocket ship emoji in it. Companies use their blogs as marketing, branding, and recruiting tools and that\u0027s okay when it\u0027s \"writing a good article will make people think of us\" but it doesn\u0027t go here if it\u0027s just a literal advert. Usually they are titled in a way that I don\u0027t spot them until somebody reports it or mentions it in the comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneric AI content that isn\u0027t technical in content. \"Does Devin mean that programming is over?\", \"Will AI put farmers out of work?\", \"Is AI art?\". For a few weeks these were the titles of about 20 articles per day, some scoring high and some low. Fashions like this come and go but I\u0027m keeping an eye on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewsletters: There are a few people that post every edition of their newsletter to reddit, where that newsletter is really just aggregating content from elsewhere. It\u0027s clear that they are trying to grow a monetised audience using reddit, but that\u0027s okay if it\u0027s providing valuable curation or if the content is good and people like it. So we\u0027ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareer posts. Personally I\u0027d like r/programming to be a deeply technical place but as mentioned there\u0027s clearly an audience for career advice. That said, the posts that are scoring the highest in this category are mostly people upvoting to agree with a statement in the title, not something that anybody is learning from. (\"Don\u0027t make your engineers context-switch.\" \"Everybody should get private offices.\" \"Micromanaging sucks.\") The ones that one could actually learn from with an instructive lean mostly don\u0027t do well; people seem to not really be interested in how to have the best 1:1s with their managers or how you went from Junior to Senior in 18 hours (though sometimes they are). That tells me that there\u0027s some subtlety to why these posts are scoring well and I\u0027m keeping an eye on the category. What I don\u0027t want is for \"vote up if you want free snacks\" to push out the good stuff or to be a farm for the other 90% of content that\u0027s really just personal brand builders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sure you\u0027re as annoyed as I am about these but they\u0027re fuzzy lines and difficult to come up with objective criteria around. As always I\u0027m looking for feedback on these and if I\u0027m missing any and any other points regarding the subreddit and moderation so let me know what you think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith all of that, here is the current set of the rules with the above changes included so I can link to them all in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eâ means that it\u0027s currently allowed, ð« means that it\u0027s not currently allowed, â ï¸ means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eâ Actual programming content.

With DBaaS, a cloud provider does all that for youâand gets you up and running right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database that handles all the complexity of deploying, managing, and healing your deployments on the cloud service provider of your choice (AWS , Azure, and GCP).

This would be the preferred method; however, you can also register using your email address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the sign-up process, you will be prompted to create an organization and a project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizations allow you to group and define users and teams, and grant them access to the different projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProjects allow you to define and organize resources such as database clusters, triggers, and data lakes. A common way to use projects is to define each environment as a project. For example, you can have a separate project for development, testing, and production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can skip this step and go directly to the management console for MongoDB Atlas. But you will need an organization and a project in order to create a database cluster, so it makes sense to do this step now. If you decide to skip it, youâll be able to create an organization and a project later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have an Atlas account and have created an organization and a project, youâll be able to create a database cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake sure you have the desired organization and project selected in the top navigation dropdowns. Then, select âClustersâ from the left navigation menu and click on the Build a Cluster button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYouâll be presented with a choice of Shared Cluster, Dedicated Cluster, and Multi-Cloud \u0026 Multi-Region Cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShared Cluster is the least expensive (or free, depending on the usage) but it utilizes shared hardware resources and network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDedicated Cluster provides you with a dedicated set of hardware and network isolation as well as the option to scale automatically within a single region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Multi-Cloud \u0026 Multi-Region Cluster builds on top of what the dedicated cluster provides.

It also allows the creation of multi-cloud clusters using any combination of cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and GCP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf youâd like to explore a little with the free tier, select the Shared Cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have selected the type of cluster, youâll be able to choose from the top three cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform) and select a region for hosting the cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYouâll also be able to select the cluster tier and additional settings, such as turn on backup and cluster name. Some options, such as the MongoDB version cloud backups, are only available with the paid cluster tiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you are satisfied with your selection, click the Create Cluster button. It may take a couple of minutes for Atlas to launch your cluster in the selected cloud hosting provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, letâs connect to the cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to access your MongoDB Atlas cluster, youâll need to enable network access for your network or IP address and create a database user for connecting to the cluster. After that, you can generate a connection string for your application or script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor security reasons, new database clusters do not have network access enabled by default. You need to enable network access explicitly by whitelisting the addresses that will connect to the cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach entry can be an IP address, a subnet, or you can enable access from any location. In general, you would grant access only to a list of subnets or IP addresses rather than grant access to any location. This limits the connections your cluster accepts, making it more secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo enable network access to your cluster, click on the Connect button from the clusters view in the Atlas management console. This will open up the connection settings wizard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to allow access from your current IP address, click on the Add your current IP address button. If you need to access it from a different IP address or subnet, click on the Add a different IP address button and enter the IP or a subnet using the CIDR notation, such as 172.10.1.0/24.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to connect to the database from a script or an application, you must first create a MongoDB database user. The database user allows you to connect and use the databases. Please note this is separate from the user that logs in and manages the clusters and resources in Atlas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase users are created per project and have access to all the clusters in the project. You can also assign different roles and privileges to the database users. Note that the first user you create will automatically be granted administrative privileges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight below the network access settings, you can create a database user. First enter the username and password and then click on the Create database user button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you later need to add more users to the project, you can do it from the Security tab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on your application, you may need to install a driver (library) corresponding to your platform in order to connect to a cluster in Atlas. You can see the full list of supported drivers here. If youâre using Compass (the MongoDB UI application) or the mongo shell application, the drivers are already built in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of your application, youâll need to generate a database connection string for your cluster. If you are just creating your cluster, the last step in the process will allow you to create a connection string. Once you have enabled network access and created a database user, you can click on the Choose connection method button, which will allow you to generate a connection string for your application. You can also create the connection string by clicking on the Connect button on your cluster from the Clusters tab in Atlas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that the connection string generated does not include the actual cluster user login. You will need to replace the \u003cusername\u003e and \u003cpassword\u003e with your actual username and password.

Our Data Structure tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur Data Structure tutorial includes all topics of Data Structure such as Array, Pointer, Structure, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Graph, Searching, Sorting, Programs, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C language. Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one after another. In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done with the help of an array of data structures. There are also other ways to organize the data in memory. Let\u0027s see the different types of data structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe data structure is not any programming language like C, C++, java, etc. It is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo structure the data in memory, \u0027n\u0027 number of algorithms were proposed, and all these algorithms are known as Abstract data types. These abstract data types are the set of rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two types of data structures:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrimitive Data structure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primitive data structures are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon-Primitive Data structure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe non-primitive data structure is divided into two types:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinear Data Structure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arrangement of data in a sequential manner is known as a linear data structure. The data structures used for this purpose are Arrays, Linked list, Stacks, and Queues. In these data structures, one element is connected to only one another element in a linear form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen one element is connected to the \u0027n\u0027 number of elements known as a non-linear data structure. The best example is trees and graphs. In this case, the elements are arranged in a random manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will discuss the above data structures in brief in the coming topics. Now, we will see the common operations that we can perform on these data structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData structures can also be classified as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe major or the common operations that can be performed on the data structures are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA data structure is a way of organizing the data so that it can be used efficiently. Here, we have used the word efficiently, which in terms of both the space and time. For example, a stack is an ADT (Abstract data type) which uses either arrays or linked list data structure for the implementation. Therefore, we conclude that we require some data structure to implement a particular ADT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ADT tells what is to be done and data structure tells how it is to be done. In other words, we can say that ADT gives us the blueprint while data structure provides the implementation part. Now the question arises: how can one get to know which data structure to be used for a particular ADT?.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the different data structures can be implemented in a particular ADT, but the different implementations are compared for time and space. For example, the Stack ADT can be implemented by both Arrays and linked list. Suppose the array is providing time efficiency while the linked list is providing space efficiency, so the one which is the best suited for the current user\u0027s requirements will be selected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following are the advantages of a data structure:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDS Basics\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDS Array\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDS Linked List\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDS Stack\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDS Queue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDS Tree\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDS Graph\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDS Searching\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDS Sorting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterview Questions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingly Linked List Programs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoubly Linked List Programs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCircular Linked List Programs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTree Programs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore learning Data Structure, you must have the basic knowledge of C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur Data Structure tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe assure that you will not find any problem in this Data Structure tutorial.

We\u0027ll give an overview of the differences between Ruby vs Ruby on Rails and Ruby vs Python, and talk about what Ruby can be used for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to programming languages in the cloud, there are plenty to choose from. But to develop applications quickly, with clean and easy-to-understand code, many developers turn to Ruby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet started with ACG and transform your career with hands-on learning around AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Linux, and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby is an open-source object-oriented scripting language invented in the mid-90s by Yukihiro Matsumoto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike languages such as C and C++, a scripting language doesnât talk directly to hardware. Itâs written to a text file and then parsed by an interpreter and turned into code. These programs are generally procedural in nature, meaning they are read from top to bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject-oriented languages, on the other hand, break out pieces of code into objects that can be created and used as needed. You can reuse these objects in other parts of the program, or even other applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYukihiro wanted to create a scripting language that leveraged object-oriented programming and increase code reuse to help speed up development. And so the Ruby programming language was born, using simple language and syntax to handle data and logic to solve problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ruby programming language is a highly portable general-purpose language that serves many purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby is great for building desktop applications, static websites, data processing services, and even automation tools. Itâs used for web servers, DevOps, and web scraping and crawling. And when you add in the functionality of the Rails application framework, you can do even more, especially database-driven web applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby stands alone as a high-level programming language. But you really can\u0027t talk about Ruby without mentioning Rails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails is the application framework that thrust Ruby into the spotlight, boosted its popularity, and made it a great language for the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the fine folks at rubyonrails.org, Ruby on Rails is âan open-source web framework that is optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity.â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ruby on Rails framework consists of pre-written Ruby code for things like communication, file handling, database connections, and more. It takes care of the tedious items, so you can focus on solving problems. One of the key concepts of Rails is DRY â Donât Repeat Yourself â which is key to the frameworkâs efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are over a million websites written in Ruby on Rails â a wide range of heavy-hitting business and entertainment sites, including GitHub, Twitch, Bloomberg, SoundCloud, Hulu, Square, Basecamp, Airbnb, Hulu, The Weather Channel, Instacart, and Twitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the languages Ruby gets compared to most often is Python. Ruby and Python have a lot in common and can be used for many of the same purposes, which can make it hard for developers who are deciding which language to learn or which to use for a specific project. Both Ruby and Python are high-level server-side scripting languages with clear and easy-to-read syntax, but there are some important technical differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the differences between Ruby vs Python include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there are the more subtle differences, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many ways, it boils down to a basic philosophical difference between the two: In Ruby, there are many ways of doing things, many solutions to one problem.

They enjoyed it enough that Ruby became one of the most popular languages for developing web applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eItâs a general use language thatâs popular in the industry. Apple, GitHub, Twitter, Hulu, ZenDesk, and Urban Dictionary are websites developed with Ruby, demonstrating its versatility.

It has a flexible approach to solving problems, which some programmers appreciate and some do not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubyâs syntax is similar to English, so many English speakers find it easy to learn and use. The program itself is free, and itâs open-source, with users sharing improvements and ideas for how to use it. The Ruby community tends to focus on web development over other types of programming and has created a vast library of program elements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the disadvantages of Rubyâs user-friendly approach is that bugs can get hidden, making it more difficult to find and fix code problems, mainly because the documentation for Ruby isnât as complete as it is for some other languages. Also, Ruby and Ruby for Rails tend to take longer to boot and have a slower runtime than other programming platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgrammers who work in either language are in demand.

A Beginnerâs Guide\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython is a relatively simple language that looks similar to English and allows users to write clean code. This can be frustrating at times, but it makes the language more usable in the long run. It supports different programming paradigms, and its user community concentrates on Linux and academic uses. It is used in industry, too, but its share of the educational market is more extensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the significant advantages of Python is that so many people know it. This means that non-developers in industries like financial services can build scripts to analyze data or connect databases. These individuals may not know enough to build entire applications, but they can add power to their applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython is not fully object-oriented, which some people find more difficult to use than Ruby. Because its user community is biased toward academic applications, the library of tools for commercial applications is smaller.

SQL provided an interface to interact with relational data, allowing analysts to connect tables by merging on common fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs time passed, the demands for faster and more disparate use ofâ¯largeâ¯dataâ¯setsâ¯became increasingly more important for emerging technology, such as e-commerce applications. Programmers needed something more flexible than SQL databases (i.e. relational databases). NoSQL became that alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile NoSQL provided an alternative to SQL, this advancement by no means replaced SQL databases. For example, let\u0027s say that you are managing retail orders at a company. In a relational model, individual tables would manage customer data, order data and product data separately, and they would be joined together through a unique, common key, such as a Customer ID or an Order ID. While this is great for storing and retrieving data quickly, it requires significant memory. When you want to add more memory, SQL databases can only scale vertically, not horizontally, which means your ability to add more memory is limited to the hardware you have. The result is that vertical scaling ultimately limits your companyâsâ¯data storageâ¯and retrieval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn comparison, NoSQL databasesâ¯areâ¯non-relational, which eliminates the need for connecting tables.Their built-in sharding and high availability capabilities ease horizontal scaling. If a single database server is not enough to store all your data or handle all the queries, the workload can be divided across two or more servers, allowing companies to scale their data horizontally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile each type of database has its own advantages, companies commonly utilize both NoSQL andâ¯relational databases in a single application. Todayâs cloud providers can support SQL orâ¯NoSQL databases. Which database you chooseâ¯depends on your goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a deeper dive into the differences between the two options, see \"SQL vs.â¯NoSQL Databases: What\u0027s the Difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn key benefits of generative AI and how organizations can incorporate generative AI and machine learning into their business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegister for the ebook on Presto\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoSQL provides other options for organizing data in many ways. By offering diverseâ¯data structures, NoSQL can be applied toâ¯data analytics, managingâ¯big data,â¯social networks, and mobile app development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAâ¯NoSQLâ¯databaseâ¯manages information using any of these primaryâ¯data models:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is typically considered the simplest form ofâ¯NoSQL databases. This schema-less data model is organized intoâ¯a dictionary of key-value pairs, where each item has a key and a value. The key could be like something similar found in a SQL database, like a shopping cart ID, while the value is an array of data, like each individual item in that userâs shopping cart. Itâs commonly used for caching and storing user session information, such as shopping carts. However, it\u0027s not ideal when you need to pull multiple records at a time. Redis and Memcached are examples of an open-source key-value databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs suggested by the name, document databases store data as documents. They can be helpful in managingâ¯semi-structuredâ¯data, and data are typically stored inâ¯JSON,â¯XML, or BSON formats. This keeps the data together when it is used in applications, reducing the amount of translation needed to use the data. Developers also gain more flexibility since data schemas do not need to match across documents (e.g. name vs. first_name). However, this can be problematic for complex transactions, leading to data corruption. Popular use cases of document databases include content management systems and user profiles. An example of a document-oriented database is MongoDB, the database component of theâ¯MEAN stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWant to know more about MongoBD? Check out the IBMâ¯tutorialâ¯on getting started with using IBM Cloud Databases forâ¯MongoDB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese databases store information in columns, enabling users to access only the specific columns they need without allocating additional memory on irrelevant data. This database tries to solve for the shortcomings of key-value and document stores, but since it can be a more complex system to manage, it is not recommended for use for newer teams and projects. Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra are examples of open-source, wide-column databases. Apacheâ¯HBase is built on top ofâ¯Hadoopâ¯Distributed Files System that provides a way of storing sparseâ¯data sets, which is commonly used in manyâ¯big dataâ¯applications. Apacheâ¯Cassandra, on the other hand, has been designed to manage large amounts of data across multiple servers and clustering that spans multipleâ¯data centers. Itâs been used for a variety of use cases, such as social networking websites and real-time data analytics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis type of database typically houses data from a knowledge graph. Data elements are stored as nodes, edges and properties. Any object, place, or person can be a node. An edge defines the relationship between the nodes. For example, a node could be a client, like IBM, and an agency like, Ogilvy. An edge would be categorize the relationship as a customer relationship between IBM and Ogilvy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraph databases are used for storing and managing a network of connections between elements within the graph. Neo4j (link resides outside IBM), a graph-basedâ¯database serviceâ¯based onâ¯Java with anâ¯open-sourceâ¯community edition where users can purchase licenses forâ¯online backupâ¯andâ¯high availabilityâ¯extensions, or pre-package licensed version with backup and extensions included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this type of database, like IBM solidDB, data resides in the main memory rather than on disk, making data access faster than with conventional, disk-based databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies have entered the NoSQL landscape. In addition to those mentioned above, here are some popularâ¯NoSQL databases:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo learn more about the state of databases, see âA Brief Overview of the Database Landscape.â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach type ofâ¯NoSQL databaseâ¯has strengths that make it better for specific use cases. However, they all share the following advantages for developers and create the framework to provide better service customers, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a nutshell,â¯NoSQL databasesâ¯provide high performance, availability, andâ¯scalability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe structure and type ofâ¯NoSQL databaseâ¯you choose will depend on how your organization plans to use it. Here are some specific uses for variousâ¯types ofâ¯NoSQL databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe need for large companies to provide services withoutâ¯latencyâ¯and to scale more quickly has spurred growth for microservices, which has led companies to examineâ¯what type of database to useâ¯for different applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies have found that using a single,â¯relational databaseâ¯for every component of an application has its limitations, especially when better alternatives exist for specific components.â¯Microservicesâ¯are an attractive option, in part, because they eliminate the need for a single, sharedâ¯data storeâ¯for an entire application. Instead, the application has many, loosely coupled and independently deployable services, each with their ownâ¯data modelâ¯and database, and integrated viaâ¯APIâ¯gateways or anâ¯iPaaS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pattern of using multiple databases within a single application, also known as polyglot persistence, has helped to create space in the market forâ¯NoSQL databasesâ¯to thrive. Today, developers can leverage the right database for the right microservice without trying to make everything work in the context of a single,â¯relational database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe data layer for hyperscale, resilient, globally available applications, based on open source Apache CouchDB\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplore key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases and learn which type of database is best for various use cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn how to accelerate the shift toward online shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplore the different factors to consider while trying to determine the best database options when refactoring to a microservices approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScale AI workloads for all your data, anywhere, with IBM watsonx.data, a fit-for-purpose data store built on an open data lakehouse architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://stackoverflow.com/","html":"\u003cp\u003eCommunities for your favorite technologies.

Well, this has been annoying for me personally and I\u0027m hoping to cut down the posts like that with this stickied post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m gathering all of these comments from posts in the subreddit and I may decide to turn this into a Wiki Page but for now it is a stickied post. :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to learn ___. Where can I learn ___?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost coding languages can be learned at W3Schools or CodeAcademy. Those are just 2 of the most popular places. If you know of others, feel free to post them in the comments below and I will edit this post to include them and credit you. :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I learn to code?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, everyone should know the basics. Not only are computers taking over the world (literally) but the internet is reaching more and more places everyday. On top of that, coding can help you learn how to use Microsoft Word or Apple Pages better. You can learn organization skills (if you keep your code organized, like myself) as well as problem solving skills. So, there are very few people who would ever tell you no that you should not learn to code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDO IT. JUST DO IT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan I use an iPad/Tablet/Laptop/Desktop to learn how to code?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, yes you can. It is more difficult to use an iPad/Tablet versus a Laptop or Desktop but all will work. You can even use your phone. Though the smaller the device, the harder it is to learn but you can. All you need to do (at the very basic) is to read about coding and try writing it down on a piece of paper. Then when you have a chance to reach a computer, you can code that and test your code to see if it works and what happens. So, go for it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs ___ worth learning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, there is a reason to learn everything. This goes hand in hand with \"Should I learn to code?\". The more you know, the more you can do with your knowledge. Yes, it may seem overwhelming but that is okay. Start with something small and get bigger and bigger from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do I start coding/programming?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a great section in our Wiki and on our sidebar that helps you out with this. First you need the tools. Once you have the tools, come up with something you want to make. Write down your top 3 things you\u0027d like to create. After that, start with #1 and work your way down the list. It doesn\u0027t matter how big or small your ideas are. If there is a will, there is a way. You will figure it out. If you aren\u0027t sure how to start, we can help you. Just use the flair [Other Code] when you post here and we can tell you where you should start (as far as what programming language you should learn).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also start using Codecademy or places like it to learn how to code.

Now I know the IT/Programming field is gigantic but that doesn\u0027t mean you have to learn everything. Most people specialize in certain areas like SQL, Pearl, Java, etc. Do you like web design? Learn HTML, CSS, C#, PHP, JavaScript, SQL \u0026 Linux (in any order). Do you like application development? Learn C#, C++, Linux, Java, etc. (in any order). No one knows everything about any one subject. Most advanced people just know a lot about certain subjects and the basics help guide them to answer more advanced questions. It\u0027s all about your problem solving skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long should it take me to learn ___?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can\u0027t tell you that. It all depends on how fast you learn. Some people learn faster than others and some people are more dedicated to the learning than others. Some people can become advanced in a certain language in days or weeks while others take months or years. Depends on your particular lifestyle, situation, and personality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e---------------------------------------------\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are the questions. if you feel like I missed something, add it to the comments below and I will update this post.

They may be outdated, broken and/or unmaintained. We recommend you use the official Julia binaries instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, make sure you have all the required dependencies installed. Then, acquire the source code by cloning the git repository:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then use the command prompt to change into the resulting julia directory. By default, you will be building the latest unstable version of Julia. However, most users should use the most recent stable version of Julia. You can get this version by running:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo build the julia executable, run make from within the julia directory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding Julia requires 2GiB of disk space and approximately 4GiB of virtual memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: The build process will fail badly if any of the build directory\u0027s parent directories have spaces or other shell meta-characters such as $ or : in their names (this is due to a limitation in GNU make).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce it is built, you can run the julia executable.

Some of the features of Laravel include modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance, and its orientation toward syntactic sugar.[4][5]:â2,â5â9â[6][7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe source code of Laravel is hosted on GitHub and licensed under the terms of MIT License.[8]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor Otwell created Laravel as an attempt to provide a more advanced alternative to the CodeIgniter framework, which did not provide certain features such as built-in support for user authentication and authorization. Laravel\u0027s first beta release was made available on June 9, 2011, followed by the Laravel 1 release later in the same month. Laravel 1 included built-in support for authentication, localisation, models, views, sessions, routing and other mechanisms, but lacked support for controllers that prevented it from being a true MVC framework.[1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaravel 2 was released in September 2011, bringing various improvements from the author and community. Major new features included the support for controllers, which made Laravel 2 a fully MVC-compliant framework, built-in support for the inversion of control (IoC) principle, and a templating system called Blade. As a downside, support for third-party packages was removed in Laravel 2.[1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaravel 3 was released in February 2012 with a set of new features including the cmd command-line interface (CLI) named Artisan, built-in support for more database management systems, database migrations as a form of version control for database layouts, support for handling events, and a packaging system called Bundles. An increase of Laravel\u0027s userbase and popularity lined up with the release of Laravel 3.[1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaravel 4, codenamed Illuminate, was released in May 2013. It was made as a complete rewrite of the Laravel framework, migrating its layout into a set of separate packages distributed through Composer, which serves as an application-level package manager. Such a layout improved the extensibility of Laravel 4, which was paired with its official regular release schedule spanning six months between minor point releases. Other new features in the Laravel 4 release include database seeding for the initial population of databases, support for message queues, built-in support for sending different types of email, and support for delayed deletion of database records called soft deletion.[1][9]:â18â19â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaravel 5 was released in February 2015 as a result of internal changes that ended up in renumbering the then-future Laravel 4.3 release.

Using a frontend framework, you can build an application with the confidence that it is compliant, well-structured, upgradeable, and maintainable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally speaking, AngularJS for beginners is used for interactive website components. Due to its efficiency, simplicity, adaptability, and constant updates, it is a highly favored framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRxjs and AngularCLI are two built-in features of Angular that are more capable of creating channels for exchanging data and independently handling events. Creating apps, adding files, and debugging a project are all a breeze when using Angular. Running the components in parallel maximizes developer efficiency and reduces code lines. As a result, angular improves overall performance. Additionally, it provides quick server-side rendering, supporting views without browser-side rendering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving AngularJS a glance and getting acquainted with its components on a sufficient level of detail is a good place to start. However, I would advise you to take your time and not try to do too much too soon. Achieve a level of fluency with the language before trying to do anything too complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS for beginners is thought to have a much steeper learning curve when compared with React. The Angular framework is verbose in comparison and its complex component management system necessitates numerous repetitive actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, the framework is constantly changing, so engineers must constantly adjust. Using TypeScript and RxJS in Angular 2+ versions is a further issue. Even though TypeScript is similar to JavaScript, learning it takes time. It won\u0027t be easy to comprehend RxJS as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, anything is possible with the right approach and zeal to learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis question has no definitive answer because it depends on each individual\u0027s motivation and learning capacities, including attention and retention spans. However, if you are willing to dedicate at least 2-3 hours per day to learning Angular, 2-3 months should be enough. It might take fewer weeks if you put in more time each day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the following may ease the process of learning AngularJS for beginners:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with this, interest and motivation are essential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelecting the appropriate JavaScript frameworks can be very confusing, especially when many options are available that are capable of fitting the project requirements. However, selecting the best framework requires knowledge of several crucial factors. The two frameworks, Angular and React, are frequently compared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReactjs is a Javascript library built using JSX, whereas Angular is a Javascript framework built using Typescript. React creates UI components for any app with frequently varying data, whereas AngularJS for beginners is primarily used to create complex enterprise-grade apps like single-page apps and progressive web apps. Due to Angular\u0027s excessive number of built-in functionalities and React\u0027s smaller package size, React is easier to learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngular, one of the most popular programming languages in recent memory, has remained popular over time. Numerous powerhouse companies and institutions use Angular in their app development pipeline, including Google (of course), Microsoft Office, Gmail, Forbes, Delta, Deutsche Bank, PayPal, and Samsung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Angular and React are two popular frameworks for creating dynamic user interfaces. Angular is a comprehensive framework that ensures data syncs across all levels, from your application to the server. Angular uses two-way data binding, which contrasts with React\u0027s one-way data binding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReact has an easier learning curve and is therefore much easier for beginners. If you\u0027re interested in job opportunities and getting started with web development quickly, it\u0027s better to start with React.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are several topics to learn in AngularJS for beginners, and this long list keeps getting longer. So, below, we will cover the essential topics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouble braces can be used to enclose AngularJS expressions: expression. They can also be written as ng-bind \u003d \"expression\" inside a directive. Then, AngularJS will resolve the expression, and the result will be returned exactly where the expression is written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpressions in Angular are much like JavaScript expressions: They can contain literals, operators, and variables. Here is an example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003cscript src\u003d\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003cdiv ng-app\u003d\"\"\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is an expression: {{ 1.5 * 5 }}\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis gives the following output:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is an expression: 7.5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn AngularJS, a module is what essentially defines an application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn AngularJS module is, by definition, a way to organize related components, directives, pipes, and services, allowing them to be combined with other modules to form applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an easier understanding of AngularJS for beginners, an Angular application can be considered a puzzle where each piece (or each module) is needed to see the full picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn AngularJS module can be created using the angular.module function. Once you have created an app you can add controllers, directives and pipelines to your application. For example, we can add a controller with the ng-controller directive:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} \u003cdiv ng-app\u003d\"exampleApp\" ng-controller\u003d\"myCtrl\"\u003e {{ FirstName + \" \" + FastName }} \u003c/div\u003e \u003cscript\u003e var app \u003d angular.module(\"exampleApp\", []); app.controller(\"myCtrl\", function($scope) { $scope.firstName \u003d \"John\"; $scope.lastName \u003d \"Doe\"; }); \u003c/script\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere \"exampleApp\" refers to an HTML element in which our AngularJS application will run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectives in AngularJS let you extend HTML by giving it new syntax. Each directive has a name; either one that is predefined by Angular, such as ng-repeat, or a custom name that can be anything. In addition, each directive specifies where it can be used, whether in an element, attribute, class, or comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS has many built-in directives which offer different functionalities and are defined using the ng- prefix. Some directives include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet us see these directives in action:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} \u003cdiv ng-app\u003d\"\" ng-init\u003d\"firstName\u003d\u0027John\u0027\"\u003e \u003cp\u003eName: \u003cinput type\u003d\"text\" ng-model\u003d\"firstName\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou wrote: {{ firstName }}\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn AngularJS, data binding refers to the synchronization of the model and the View. Applications using AngularJS typically have a data model. The data model is a set of information that the application can use. Data binding binds AngularJS expressions with AngularJS data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have already seen Data Binding in action. In the previous example, the {{ FirstName }} expression is an AngularJS data binding expression as it is bound with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} ng-model\u003d\"FirstName.\" {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore specifically, you can usually use the ng-bind directive, which will bind the innerHTML of the element to the specified model property:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} \u003cp ng-bind\u003d\"Firstname\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the previous example, you can also display the content from the model using double braces {{ }}:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} \u003cp\u003eFirst name: {{Firstname}}\u003c/p\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn AngularJS, controllers are what control the data in AngularJS applications. Controllers are regular JavaScript objects created by regular JavaScript object constructors. Therefore, all AngularJS applications are in some way controlled by controllers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can add controllers to your application by using the ng-controller directive. Let us take a look at an example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} \u003cdiv ng-app\u003d\"exampleApp\" ng-controller\u003d\"exampleController\"\u003e First Name: \u003cinput type\u003d\"text\" ng-model\u003d\"FirstName\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Last Name: \u003cinput type\u003d\"text\" ng-model\u003d\"LastName\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Full Name: {{FirstName + \" \" + LastName}} \u003c/div\u003e \u003cscript\u003e var app \u003d angular.module(exampleApp, []); app.controller(exampleController, function($scope) { $scope.FirstName \u003d \"John\"; $scope.LastName \u003d \"Doe\"; }); \u003c/script\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this example, we define a controller using the ng-controller directive having two-controller properties: FirstName and LastName. We also define a JavaScript function named \"exampleController\" and add it to our \"exampleApp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing controllers, we can add a different method to our application as variable functions. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} \u003cdiv ng-app\u003d\"myApp\" ng-controller\u003d\"exampleController\"\u003e First Name: \u003cinput type\u003d\"text\" ng-model\u003d\"FirstName\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Last Name: \u003cinput type\u003d\"text\" ng-model\u003d\"LastName\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Full Name: {{FullName()}} \u003c/div\u003e \u003cscript\u003e var app \u003d angular.module(\u0027myApp\u0027, []); app.controller(\u0027exampleController\u0027, function($scope) { $scope.FirstName \u003d \"John\"; $scope.LastName \u003d \"Doe\"; $scope.FullName \u003d function() { return $scope.FirstName + \" \" + $scope.LastName; }; }); \u003c/script\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, even load controllers from external files. We can do this by adding the code between the \u003cscript\u003e tags into an external file like exampleController.js:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %}\u003cdiv ng-app\u003d\"myApp\" ng-controller\u003d\"exampleController\"\u003e First Name: \u003cinput type\u003d\"text\" ng-model\u003d\"FirstName\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Last Name: \u003cinput type\u003d\"text\" ng-model\u003d\"LastName\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Full Name: {{FullName()}} \u003c/div\u003e \u003cscript src\u003d\"exampleController.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS applications consist of 3 components:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scope is the Model that binds the View to the Controller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS scopes are JavaScript objects with methods and properties available for both the View and the controller. When making a controller in an AngularJS application, you can pass in a scope object as an argument. Let us take a look at an example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} \u003cdiv ng-app\u003d\"myApp\" ng-controller\u003d\"myCtrl\"\u003e \u003ch1\u003e{{carname}}\u003c/h1\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cscript\u003e var app \u003d angular.module(\u0027myApp\u0027, []); app.controller(\u0027myCtrl\u0027, function($scope) { $scope.carname \u003d \"Volvo\"; }); \u003c/script\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you add properties to a scope object in the application controller, the View also gets access to these properties. Thus, the model, View, and controller also get updated when you update the scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS filters allow users to format data in the user interface without altering the original format. AngularJS provides a plethora of filters to transform data:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilters in AngularJS can be added to expressions used in the pipeline | character followed by a filter. Let\u0027s look at an example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} \u003cdiv ng-app\u003d\"exampleApp\" ng-controller\u003d\"exampleController\"\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe name is {{ LastName | uppercase }}\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRouting allows your application to route different pages without reloading the entire application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse the ngRoute module if you want to navigate between different pages within your application but also want it to be an SPA (Single Page Application) with no page reloading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo enable routing in your application, you need to integrate the AngularJS Route module:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} \u003cscript src\u003d\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular-route.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter integration, you need to add the ngRoute dependency in your application module:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{% code-block language\u003d\"js\" %} var app \u003d angular.module(\"myApp\", [\"ngRoute\"]); {% code-block-end %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning the above code will give your application access to the route module, which in turn provides the $routeProvider. First, use the $routeProvider to configure different routes in your application. Then your application needs a container to put the content provided by the routing. This container is the ng-view directive. There are three ways to include the ng-view directive in your application that would be covered in the fundamentals of any Angular course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore getting started with AngularJS, you need to understand the fundamentals of JavaScript. JavaScript is a universal language with a vast array of frameworks and libraries like AngularJS that is immensely helpful to developers in the web development world.

Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter, and released as an open source product in August 2011 on GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2014 Bootstrap was the No.1 project on GitHub!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvantages of Bootstrap:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis tutorial follows Bootstrap 3, which was released in 2013. However, we also cover newer versions; Bootstrap 4 (released 2018) and Bootstrap 5 (released 2021).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap; with new components, faster stylesheets, more responsiveness etc. It supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 \u0026 4, is that Bootstrap 5 has switched to JavaScript instead of jQuery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is still supported by the team for critical bugfixes and documentation changes, and it is perfectly safe to continue to use them. However, new features will NOT be added to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two ways to start using Bootstrap on your own web site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, go to getbootstrap.com, and follow the instructions there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap\u0027s CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne advantage of using the Bootstrap CDN: Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap from MaxCDN when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN\u0027s will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejQuery Bootstrap uses jQuery for JavaScript plugins (like modals, tooltips, etc). However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don\u0027t need jQuery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Add the HTML5 doctype\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBootstrap uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the HTML5 doctype.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the lang attribute and the correct character set:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBootstrap 3 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following \u003cmeta\u003e tag inside the \u003chead\u003e element:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe width\u003ddevice-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe initial-scale\u003d1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3.

This includes everything from markup and coding to scripting, network configuration, and CMS development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs someone who\u0027s spent countless hours coding and experimenting with websites, I\u0027ve come to see web development as more than just markup and coding; it\u0027s an art form, a way of bringing ideas to life. While web development typically refers to web markup and coding, website development includes all related development tasks, such as client-side scripting, server-side scripting, server and network security configuration, ecommerce development, and content management system (CMS) development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those looking for a more streamlined and user-friendly approach, HubSpot\u0027s drag-and-drop website builder offers a practical solution, allowing you to focus on design and content without the need for extensive coding knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in the ins-and-outs of web development, Iâm excited to share with you the basics of web development and the exhilarating process of creating a website from scratch. I remember the first website I ever builtâit was full of bright colors and clunky animations, but it was mine, and it sparked a lifelong passion. Through trial and error, I\u0027ve personally discovered the joy of turning complex problems into elegant solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel free to leap around the guide using the chapter links.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb Development Basics\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypes of Web Development\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Web Development Process\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb Development Resources\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you believe that we\u0027re part of a world where over 5.30 billion people are connected through the Internet? That\u0027s more than half of our global population, actively engaging in research, connection, education, and entertainment through this incredible digital universe. Personally, I believe the Internet isnât just a luxury; it\u0027s a fundamental part of our daily lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the rapidly increasing number of Internet users, itâs no surprise that web development is a rapidly expanding industry. Between now and 2030, the employment of web developers is expected to grow by 13%, much faster than most other technology careers. It\u0027s an exciting time to be in this field, and I\u0027m thrilled to be part of this dynamic industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee why thousands of customers use Content Hub to build an optimized website that integrates with their HubSpot CRM data and full marketing suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFree code snippet templates for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- Plus access to GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick this link to access this resource at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb development and web programming sound very similar â and they are. But thereâs one very important distinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb development refers to the overall process of creating websites or web applications, including the projectâs design, layout, coding, content creation, and functionality. It involves using a combination of programming languages, tools, and frameworks to bring a website or web application to life. It may also encompass project management activities, such as fielding development requests from stakeholders or freelance clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb programming, on the other hand, specifically refers to the coding and scripting of a website, whether the front-end or back-end. It primarily involves writing code to handle data, process user inputs, and generate dynamic content. A web programmer will rarely, if ever, handle a web development project from end to end. They may build a certain section of a site or troubleshoot bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding this difference has been crucial in my career, allowing me to appreciate the depth and breadth of skills required in the world of web creation. It\u0027s a reminder of the diverse talents and expertise that come together to make the digital world what it is today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWebsites are files stored on servers, which are computers that host (fancy term for âstore files forâ) websites. These servers are connected to a giant network called the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, how do we access these websites? This is where browsers come into play. Browsers are computer programs that load websites via your Internet connection, such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer, while the computers used to access these websites are known as âclientsâ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was always fascinated by how the Internet knows where to send data. The answer lies in understanding IP addresses. To access a website, you need to know its Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a unique string of numbers. Each device has an IP address to distinguish itself from the billions of websites and devices connected via the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe IP address for HubSpot is 104.16.249.5. You can find any websiteâs IP address by visiting a site like Site 24x7 or by using Command Prompt on Windows or Network Utility \u003e Traceroute on MacBooks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo find your deviceâs IP address, you can also type âwhatâs my IP addressâ into your search browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile you can access a website using its IP address, most Internet users prefer to use domain names or by going through search engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is what connects our website request to the remote server that houses all website data. Itâs a set of rules (a protocol) that defines how messages should be sent over the Internet. It allows us to jump between site pages and websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I type a website into my web browser or search for something through a search engine, HTTP provides a framework so that the client (computer) and server can speak the same language when they make requests and responses to each other over the Internet. Itâs essentially the translator between you and the Internet â it reads our website request, reads the code sent back from the server, and translates it for us in the form of a website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoding refers to writing code for servers and applications using programming languages. Theyâre called âlanguagesâ because they include vocabulary and grammatical rules for communicating with computers. They also include special commands, abbreviations, and punctuation that can only be read by devices and programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll software is written in at least one coding language, but languages vary based on platform, operating system, and style. All languages fall into one of two categories: front-end and back-end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFront-end (or client-side) is the side of a website or software that you see and interact with as an Internet user. When website information is transferred from a server to a browser, front-end coding languages allow the website to function without having to continually âcommunicateâ with the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFront-end code allows users to interact with a website and play videos, expand or minimize images, highlight text, and more. Web developers who work on front-end coding work on client-side development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back-end (or server-side) is the side that you donât see when you use the Internet. Itâs the digital infrastructure, and to non-developers, it looks like a bunch of numbers, letters, and symbols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are more back-end coding languages than front-end languages. Thatâs because browsers â at the front-end â only understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but a server â at the back-end â can be configured to understand pretty much any language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA content management system (CMS) is a web application or a series of programs used to create and manage web content. (Note: CMS\u0027s arenât the same as site builders, like Squarespace or Wix.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee why thousands of customers use Content Hub to build an optimized website that integrates with their HubSpot CRM data and full marketing suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile not required to build a website, using a CMS makes things easier. It provides the building blocks (like plugins and add-ons) and lets you create the structure with your code. CMS\u0027s are often used for ecommerce and blogging, but theyâre useful for all types of websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are always malicious actors looking to find vulnerabilities in websites to expose private information, steal data, and crash servers. Cybersecurity is the practice of securing data, networks, and computers from these threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe methods used by hackers are constantly evolving, as are the security measures taken to defend against them. Failing to understand how your site could be targeted could result in disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, a basic understanding of cybersecurity best practices is critical for effective web development. You should also carry out security audits on a consistent basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFree code snippet templates for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- Plus access to GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick this link to access this resource at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy journey into web development began in the vibrant world of front-end development, where I loved turning code into visually appealing, interactive web pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, I dived into back-end development, uncovering the nuts and bolts that power a website. Learning Python and Ruby, I gained a deeper appreciation for the seamless integration of front-end and back-end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether youâre looking to hire a web developer or become one, you should understand the different types of web development that developers can master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese different types of web development primarily refer to the different sectors of the profession in which web developers can work. Some of these distinctions overlap, and web developers will often master multiple types of web development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFront-end developers work on the client- or user-facing side of websites, programs, and software â in other words, what users see. They design and develop the visual aspects, including the layout, navigation, graphics, and other aesthetics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main job of these developers is to build interfaces that help users reach their goals, which is why they also often have a hand in the user experience aspect of their projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the front-end is what users see, the back-end is what they donât. Back-end web developers work on the servers of websites, programs, and software to make sure everything works properly behind-the-scenes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese developers work with systems like servers, operating systems, APIs, and databases and manage the code for security, content, and site architecture. They collaborate with front-end developers to bring their products to users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFull stack developers work in both the front-end and back-end sides of a website. They can create a website, application, or software program from start to finish. âStackâ refers to the different technologies that handle different functionalities on the same website, like the server, interface, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause full-stack developers require years in the field to build the necessary experience, this role is often sought after by companies looking to build or update their websites. This developer\u0027s all-around knowledge helps them optimize performance, catch issues before they occur, and help team members understand different parts of a web service. This comprehensive skill set is typically covered in a full stack developer course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWebsite developers can be front-end, back-end, or full-stack developers. However, these professionals specialize in building websites, as opposed to mobile applications, desktop software, or video games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesktop developers specialize in building software applications that run locally on your device, rather than over the Internet in the web browser. Sometimes the skillset of these developers overlaps with that of web developers if an application can run both online and off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMobile developers build applications for mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets. Mobile apps operate much differently than other websites and software programs, thus requiring a separate set of development skills and knowledge of specialized programming languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame developers specialize in writing code for video games, including console games (Xbox, PlayStation, etc.), PC games, and mobile games â which means this specialty overlaps somewhat with mobile development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbedded developers work with all hardware that isn\u0027t a computer (or, at least, what most of us imagine as âcomputers,â with a keyboard and screen). This includes electronic interfaces, consumer devices, IoT devices, real-time systems, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a recent rise in interconnected devices as seen with smart appliances, Bluetooth technologies, and virtual assistants, embedded development is becoming an in-demand practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity developers establish methods and procedures for the security of a software program or website. These developers typically work as ethical hackers, trying to âbreakâ websites to expose vulnerabilities without intending harm. They also build systems that discover and eradicate security risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0027ve already discussed, front-end web development focuses on creating the visual and interactive elements of a site. It involves designing and building the user-facing side â what you see, essentially, when you pull up a site in a web browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my perspective, front-end development is likely the âeasiestâ way to begin a career in web development. That said, as with any other aspect of this field, it will have a learning curve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some of the most popular front-end web development languages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHTML is likely the language you first thought of when it comes to web development, and with good reason: HTML is the backbone of any web page. It provides both semantic structure and defines the elements of a website, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Web developers use HTML to give content a proper layout before customizing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow is the HTML code for a basic Bootstrap button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee the Pen Untitled by HubSpot (@hubspot) on CodePen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf HTML is the backbone of a site, then CSS is the meat. CSS is responsible for styling the visual appearance of a website. It allows developers to customize colors, fonts, layouts, and other design elements. With CSS, you can also create responsive web pages that adapt to different screen sizes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0027s a code snippet for customizing the jumbotron element in Bootstrap CSS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee the Pen Untitled by HubSpot (@hubspot) on CodePen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript is a dynamic programming language that adds interactive elements to web pages, such as dropdown menus, sliders, forms, and animations. JavaScript is widely used for client-side scripting (that is, the script runs on the clientâs browser, and not on the server that hosts the website). JavaScript generally enhances the user experience by making websites more dynamic and engaging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow is a JavaScript code snippet for automatically opening links in a new window in WordPress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee the Pen Untitled by HubSpot (@hubspot) on CodePen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejQuery is a fast and lightweight JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML manipulation and event handling. It provides a variety of functions and methods to select elements, create animations, and handle AJAX requests. jQuery is compatible with all modern browsers and simplifies cross-browser development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReact is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of an application. React has gained significant adoption and is widely used for developing complex web applications with a responsive and interactive user interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese languages play a crucial role in creating visually appealing, intuitive, and interactive websites. Donât underestimate them: A website may have the best back-end structure, but unless the UI is modern, interactive, and user-friendly, it wonât be as appealing to a visitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile front-end developers focus on creating the user-facing elements of a website, back-end developers work behind the scenes to ensure everything runs smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs opposed to altering the user-facing side, from my experience, back-end development languages help programmers manipulate servers, databases, and software that power websites and apps. That makes it a little harder than learning front-end development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some of the most common back-end web development languages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTangible tips and coding templates from experts to help you code better and faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick this link to access this resource at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython is a versatile and more beginner-friendly programming language known for its readability and simplicity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt offers a wide range of frameworks, such as Django and Flask, that simplify back-end development tasks like database management and handling HTTP requests. Python\u0027s extensive libraries and frameworks make it a popular choice among back-end developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePHP is a widely-used server-side scripting language specifically designed for web development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePHP seamlessly integrates with HTML and provides powerful features for handling databases, generating dynamic content, and interacting with web servers. Popular PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symfony enhance productivity and maintainability for complex web applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby is a dynamic and object-oriented programming language that prioritizes simplicity and readability. It is most commonly associated with the Ruby on Rails framework, which provides a structure for building robust and scalable web applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby\u0027s elegant syntax and extensive ecosystem make it a preferred choice for web development projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its platform independence and scalability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is commonly used for building enterprise-level web applications that require high performance and security. Java frameworks like Spring and Hibernate offer tools for building complex back-end systems with ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# (pronounced C-sharp) is a modern, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft. It is primarily used for building Windows desktop applications and web services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the rise of the .NET framework, C# has gained popularity as a back-end language for developing scalable and secure web applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNode.js is a JavaScript runtime (that is, the environment where your JavaScript code executes) built on Chrome\u0027s V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side, opening up opportunities for full-stack JavaScript development. Node.js is highly scalable, efficient, and ideal for building real-time applications and APIs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember, back-end developers need to have a solid understanding of databases, server management, and web security, in addition to their language proficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThatâs why back-end development is generally a little harder than front-end development, but itâs still plenty learnable nonetheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my experience as a web developer, I remember tackling projects without a clear process in place. It felt like trying to assemble a puzzle without having the picture on the box. It wasn\u0027t until I started working on a complex ecommerce site that the importance of a structured approach really hit home. The project demanded a mix of front-end and back-end development, each with its specific languages and frameworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy establishing a clear process, breaking down tasks, and systematically approaching each phase, the project became manageable and even enjoyable. Trust me, developing a robust process is not just helpful; it\u0027s essential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some key steps I found most helpful in my website development process journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore laying pen to paper or hands to keyboard, it\u0027s vital to first connect with teams and personnel across your organization to develop a plan for your website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some questions to consider before your first site draft:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnswering the questions requires interfacing with your web development, marketing, and financial teams to determine your priorities and make informed decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePut simply? Itâs much easier to create a roadmap at the beginning of the process than reverting your progress at a roadblock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll good websites start with a blueprint. Developers call this a wireframe. It doesnât have to be an official document; itâs simply a vision for your site thatâll give both you and your developer(s) direction and a place to start. You can draw it on a whiteboard or use a tool like Invision, Slickplan, or Mindnode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWireframes are strictly visual tools that will help you understand where text and images will go on individual web pages. You can use blank boxes and âdummy textâ to get an idea of how your content will show up on the front-end. If you\u0027re working with a company or freelancer, I\u0027d recommend creating a wireframe so you have an idea of what your final product will be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFree code snippet templates for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- Plus access to GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick this link to access this resource at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, itâs time to create a sitemap (not to be confused with sitemap.XML, which is an XML file that helps search engines crawl and find your site). Just like a business plan gives a potential investor insight into your goals and deliverables, a sitemap gives a developer the information needed to meet your vision. You can create your sitemap on your own or work with your developer(s).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are a few questions to ask yourself when planning your site:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, itâs a good idea to consult with other teams within your organization. If you have an SEO and/or content strategy team, their input will be critical in the linking structure and categorizing of your pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting code might be one of the more complicated parts of web development, but itâs hardly the only component. You also have to build your back-end and front-end site structures and design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetâs start with the back-end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back-end handles the data that enables the functionality on the front-end. For example, Facebook\u0027s back-end stores my photos, so that the front-end can then allow others to look at them. Itâs made up of two key components:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese components work together to build the foundation for each website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for building your website, backend developers will establish three things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith these components and decisions in place, your website will be ready for front-end development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: The back-end is slightly tangential to web development because you don\u0027t always need a back-end if you\u0027re not storing any data. âDataâ in this context means any user-entered information that you need to save and persist. Think about logging in to a website. If they don\u0027t have a back-end, how could they remember your login information? Or what your profile settings are? To get this information, you need a back-end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook, as an example, needs to know what people are in your Friends list, what events you have joined, what posts you have created, and more. This is all \"data\" that lives in a database. If they didn\u0027t have a back-end with a database, none of that data would be accessible to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, a website thatâs purely informational and doesnât require the users to enter any data wouldnât need a back-end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, if you have no data, you donât necessarily require back-end development. But thatâs not saying you shouldnât learn the basics. You never know when you might need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFree code snippet templates for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- Plus access to GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick this link to access this resource at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf youâve ever dabbled in web design or toyed with a website in WordPress, Squarespace, or Google Sites, youâve touched front-end web development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front-end stuff is important â itâs what your visitors, customers, and users see and how theyâll use your website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFront-end (or client-side) development includes a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It also controls components such as typography and fonts, navigation, positioning, and browser compatibility and responsiveness. This part will reflect more of your initial site vision and what you included in your wireframe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs technology and consumer preferences change, client-side coding tends to become outdated much faster than back-end development. This is where coding resources (like the ones weâve included below) come in handy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would someone choose a CMS over coding âby handâ or âfrom scratch?â Itâs true that a CMS is less flexible and, therefore, gives you less control over your front-end. However, a CMS is easier to use (you have to write less code), and it often has tools for hosting the site, creating your website, storing user information, creating a blog, publishing landing pages, capturing leads, and even building an email list. As a result, youâll be able to make your website more profitable with less than half the work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee why thousands of customers use HubSpot\u0027s CMS to build an optimized website that integrates with their HubSpot CRM data and full marketing stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCMS options often include plugins that remove the need to write a back-end. For example, there are WordPress plugins for ecommerce so that, instead of building a complicated back-end to charge customersâ credit cards, you can just use an existing plugin and avoid the need to deal with databases and server-side code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePopular content management systems include HubSpot, Joomla, Magento, and WordPress â which has over 65% market share. (In this case, weâre talking about open source WordPress software, not the WordPress site builder.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, your website will have an IP address. It also needs a domain name, a memorable website name that your visitors can use to find your site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps youâve heard of sites like GoDaddy and Hover. These services help you purchase a domain name and register with ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Most domain registrations are good for a year before youâre required to renew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWebsite builders and hosting services, like WordPress and Squarespace, also allow you to purchase a domain name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce youâve set up a domain name and linked it to your host, youâre almost ready to unveil your work to the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not so fast â there are still a handful of things youâll need to check before an official launch. These include planning out responsibilities on your team, testing your site thoroughly for any glitches, optimizing for SEO, and a final check before âflipping the switchâ and making your site live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I\u0027ve learned is that continuous learning is key. When I hit a roadblock on a tricky coding problem, I discovered the wealth of online resources available. Outside of connecting and networking with other developers, there are plenty of resources you can tap into to further your understanding of web development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you want to explore back-end, front-end, or full-stack coding, here are a few online courses and classes that I recommend along with many HubSpot developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe HubSpot Website Blog stands as a go-to source for both beginners and seasoned learners. With a focus on delivering actionable insights and practical advice, this blog simplifies the complexities of back-end, front-end, and full-stack coding.

Also known as Oracle relational database management system (RDBMS), Oracle is a fully configurable and scalable solution that stores data as objects while maintaining relationships between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current stable version of the Oracle database is 19c, where c denotes cloud compatibility. Itâs the first converged, multi-model database solution of Oracle that supports multiple data types and workloads with real-time data analytics capabilities. This eliminates the hassle of maintaining separate databases to store different forms of data, such as multimedia content, text, and geospatial information. As a unified data hub, Oracle also simplifies data governance, management, and access. Users can retrieve data from an Oracle relational database through structured query language (SQL). Oracle RDBMS is also compatible with most operating systems, including Windows and macOS, and has five different editions: Enterprise, Personal, Standard, Express, and Lite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOracle database and SQL database are two popular commercial enterprise database solutions. Choosing between Oracle database vs. SQL is often challenging for businesses. Outlined below are some of the key differences between these two database management systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlatform support: Oracle runs smoothly across most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and OS-X. In contrast, SQL is a Microsoft database solution, so is only compatible with Windows. However, from 2017 onwards, it also supports the Linux OS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuery language: PL/SQL is used to manipulate the data in Oracle, whereas SQL users perform database CRUD operations using transact SQL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplexity: The query language Oracle database (PL/SQL) varies significantly from SQL. This makes the syntax of Oracle complex compared to SQL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePackages support: Oracle DB offers support for packages to enhance the overall database functionality. Users can also create their own packages in it, unlike SQL database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJob scheduling and query optimization: Oracle Scheduler handles the job creation and scheduling in Oracle database. It leverages the star optimization technique to improve the query execution time. SQL Server, in contrast, uses the SQL Server Agent for job scheduling but doesnât support query optimization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransaction control and error handling: This is typically considered better in Oracle compared to SQL database. Any change in database values happens in the computer memory initially and requires an external COMMIT statement from the user for permanent alteration in the Oracle database. Every new connection is treated as an individual transaction in this database for quick error resolution. SQL Server, in contrast, executes every operation within a particular transaction sequentially, making error control difficult. Users cannot roll back a transaction in SQL Server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOracle relational database has applications in areas like data warehousing and enterprise grid computing. It allows businesses to catalog and retrieve multiple types of data securely. Oracle database software is typically installed on a server to handle the information management challenges in a multi-user, enterprise environment. Once installed, it enables fine-grained access control by restricting unauthorized access to file directories. Users can also access data concurrently without any performance delay using Oracle database. Further, Oracle database tools offer data backup and recovery capabilities for unexpected failures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe separation of Oracle database architecture into physical and logical storage makes it useful for grid computing, a cost-effective technique to build and manage applications at scale by rapidly provisioning resources from a large pool of modular storage units and servers. This structure creates a modular data storage system in which capacity can be adjusted as per demand without affecting the database operations. The scalability aspect of Oracle database software also makes it highly effective in enterprises where multiple databases often need to be configured and accessed quickly with minimum downtime. Other areas where you can use the Oracle database includes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomatic storage management (ASM): As a self-managing database, Oracle automates a majority of database administration tasks, including storage management. It automatically distributes the data across available physical disks to simplify file management and improve system performance. Oracle ASM can also redistribute file content after changes in the database storage configuration. Additionally, it eliminates the need for conventional data management tools, such as filing systems, raw disks, and volume management software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClustering: Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) allow businesses to host a single database on multiple clustered nodes or servers to ensure high availability and avoid a single point of failure. In the clustered setup, if one server abruptly fails, the database proceeds to run on the remaining instances to reduce the impact of service disruptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemory caching: Oracle relational database offers flexible caching options for faster read/write operations. For instance, certain pieces of data in an organization should be instantly accessible, such as customer data and recent orders. With Oracle In-Memory Database Cache (IMDB), businesses can cache this information in the application tier for real-time access, fast response time, and high transaction throughput.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutlined below are some of the noteworthy features of Oracle database software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortability: Oracle database software is highly portable as it runs across multiple operating systems and supports various applications, from transaction processing to analytics and business intelligence. Its networking stack allows applications from a different platform to connect with it seamlessly. For instance, applications running on Linux OS can connect to an Oracle database installed on Windows quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScalability and performance: With features like In-Memory Database Cache (IMDB), real application clusters (RAC), and advanced data compression, Oracle database software offers high performance and low latency in real-time environments. It also maintains data concurrency and consistency in the multi-user environment using a multi-version consistency model and different locking mechanisms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh availability: Oracle database software has built-in capabilities and tools designed to help IT teams maximize the availability of their critical customer databases. Examples include Oracle RAC, Data Guard, Oracle Multitenant, and Oracle Sharding. Businesses can use these tools in different combinations to optimize data availability in high-performance computing environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity: Organizations can demonstrate compliance and reduce the risk of data breaches by using Oracle database security tools and technologies, such as Database Vault, Label Security, and Data Safe. IT staff can enable data masking, activity monitoring, and privileged access control to protect the Oracle relational database from potential threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBackup and recovery: Oracle database has impeccable data backup and recovery capabilities, allowing IT teams to restore critical information quickly after a failure. For instance, it offers a powerful solution, Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance, that takes automated incremental backups to minimize the backup period and ensure a faster, cost-effective recovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFounded in 1977 by Larry Ellison and other developers, Oracle Database is one of the most popular commercial enterprise database solutions that stores data in interlinked tables and columns.

Rails is a modelâviewâcontroller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don\u0027t repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.[4]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails\u0027 emergence in 2005 greatly influenced web app development, through innovative features such as seamless database table creations, migrations, and scaffolding of views to enable rapid application development.

[citation needed] In August 2006, the framework reached a milestone when Apple announced that it would ship Ruby on Rails with Mac OS X v10.5 \"Leopard\",[9] which was released in October 2007.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails version 2.3 was released on 15 March 2009, with major new developments in templates, engines, Rack and nested model forms. Templates enable the developer to generate a skeleton application with custom gems and configurations. Engines give developers the ability to reuse application pieces complete with routes, view paths and models. The Rack web server interface and Metal allow one to write optimized pieces of code that route around Action Controller.[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn 23 December 2008, Merb, another web application framework, was launched, and Ruby on Rails announced it would work with the Merb project to bring \"the best ideas of Merb\" into Rails 3, ending the \"unnecessary duplication\" across both communities.[11] Merb was merged with Rails as part of the Rails 3.0 release.[12][13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 3.1 was released on 31 August 2011, featuring Reversible Database Migrations, Asset Pipeline, Streaming, jQuery as default JavaScript library and newly introduced CoffeeScript and Sass into the stack.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 3.2 was released on 20 January 2012 with a faster development mode and routing engine (also known as Journey engine), Automatic Query Explain and Tagged Logging.[15] Rails 3.2.x is the last version that supports Ruby 1.8.7.[16] Rails 3.2.12 supports Ruby 2.0.[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 4.0 was released on 25 June 2013, introducing Russian Doll Caching, Turbolinks, Live Streaming as well as making Active Resource, Active Record Observer and other components optional by splitting them as gems.[18]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 4.1 was released on 8 April 2014, introducing Spring, Variants, Enums, Mailer previews, and secrets.yml.[19]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 4.2 was released on 19 December 2014, introducing Active Job, asynchronous emails, Adequate Record, Web Console, and foreign keys.[20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 5.0 was released on 30 June 2016, introducing Action Cable, API mode, and Turbolinks 5.[21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 5.0.0.1 was released on 10 August 2016, with Exclusive use of rails CLI over Rake and support for Ruby version 2.2.2 and above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 5.1 was released on 27 April 2017, introducing JavaScript integration changes (management of JavaScript dependencies from NPM via Yarn, optional compilation of JavaScript using Webpack, and a rewrite of Rails UJS to use vanilla JavaScript instead of depending on jQuery), system tests using Capybara, encrypted secrets, parameterized mailers, direct \u0026 resolved routes, and a unified form_with helper replacing the form_tag/form_for helpers.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 5.2 was released on 9 April 2018, introducing new features that include ActiveStorage, built-in Redis Cache Store, updated Rails Credentials and a new DSL that allows for configuring a Content Security Policy for an application.[23]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 5.2.2 was released on 4 December 2018, introducing numerous bug fixes and several logic improvements.[24]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 6.0 was released on 16 August 2019, making Webpack default, adding mailbox routing, a default online rich-text editor, parallel testing, multiple database support, mailer routing and a new autoloader.[25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 6.1 was released on 9 December 2020, adding per-database connection switching, horizontal database sharding, eager loading of all associations, Delegated Types as an alternative to single-table inheritance, asynchronous deletion of associations, error objects, and other improvements and bug fixes.[26]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 7.0 was released on 15 December 2021, replacing Node.js and Webpack with import maps for JavaScript management by default, replacing Turbolinks with a combination of Turbo and Stimulus, adding at-work encryption into Active Record, using Zeitwerk exclusively for code loading, and more.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 7.1 was released on 5 October 2023, Dockerfiles support using Kamal in order to deploy your application, authentication improvements, and now including support for bun.[28]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails evolves radically from release to release exploring the use of new technologies and adopting new standards on the Internet. Some features are very stable in Ruby on Rails while some are replaced in favour of new techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe modelâviewâcontroller (MVC) pattern is the fundamental structure to organize application programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a default configuration, a model in the Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database and to a Ruby file. For example, a model class User will usually be defined in the file \u0027user.rb\u0027 in the app/models directory, and linked to the table \u0027users\u0027 in the database. While developers are free to ignore this convention and choose differing names for their models, files, and database table, this is not common practice and is usually discouraged in accordance with the \"convention-over-configuration\" philosophy.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA controller is a server-side component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which view file to render. The controller may also have to query one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need to query a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need to query models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes how to respond to a specific external web-browser request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use RESTful routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA view in the default configuration of Rails is an erb file, which is evaluated and converted to HTML at run-time. Alternatively, many other templating systems can be used for views.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails includes tools that make common development tasks easier \"out-of-the-box\", such as scaffolding that can automatically construct some of the models and views needed for a basic website.[47] Also included are WEBrick, a simple Ruby web server that is distributed with Ruby, and Rake, a build system, distributed as a gem. Together with Ruby on Rails, these tools provide a basic development environment.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails is most commonly not connected to the Internet directly, but through some front-end web server. Mongrel was generally preferred[by whom?] over WEBrick in the early days,[citation needed] but it can also run on Lighttpd, Apache, Cherokee, Hiawatha, Nginx (either as a module â Phusion Passenger for example â or via CGI, FastCGI or mod ruby), and many others. From 2008 onward, Passenger replaced Mongrel as the most-used web server for Ruby on Rails.[48] Ruby is also supported natively on IBM i.[49]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails is also noteworthy for its extensive use of the JavaScript libraries Prototype and Script.aculo.us for scripting Ajax actions.[50] Ruby on Rails initially utilized lightweight SOAP for web services; this was later replaced by RESTful web services. Ruby on Rails 3.0 separates the markup of the page (which defines the structure of the page) from scripting (which determines functionality or logic of the page).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince version 2.0, Ruby on Rails offers both HTML and XML as standard output formats. The latter is the facility for RESTful web services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails 3.1 introduced Sass as standard CSS templating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy default, the server uses Embedded Ruby in the HTML views, with files having an html.erb extension. Rails supports swapping-in alternative templating languages, such as HAML and Mustache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails 3.0 has been designed to work with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.2, and JRuby 1.5.2+; earlier versions are not supported.[51]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails 3.2 is the last series of releases that support Ruby 1.8.7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails is separated into various packages, namely ActiveRecord (an object-relational mapping system for database access), Action Pack, Active Support and Action Mailer. Prior to version 2.0, Ruby on Rails also included the Action Web Service package that is now replaced by Active Resource. Apart from standard packages, developers can make plugins to extend existing packages. Earlier Rails supported plugins within their own custom framework; version 3.2 deprecates these in favor of standard Ruby \"gems\".[52]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails is often installed using RubyGems, a package manager[53] which is included with current versions of Ruby. Many free Unix-like systems also support installation of Ruby on Rails and its dependencies through their native package management system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails is typically deployed with a database server such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and a web server such as Apache running the Phusion Passenger module.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby on Rails is intended to emphasize Convention over Configuration (CoC), and the Don\u0027t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rails Doctrine is an enduring enabler that guides the philosophy, design, and implementation of the Ruby on Rails framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Convention over Configuration\" means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class Sale in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called sales by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table \"products sold\", that the developer needs to write code regarding these names. Generally, Ruby on Rails conventions lead to less code and less repetition.[54]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t repeat yourself\" means that information is located in a single, unambiguous place. For example, using the ActiveRecord module of Rails, the developer does not need to specify database column names in class definitions. Instead, Ruby on Rails can retrieve this information from the database based on the class name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fat models, skinny controllers\" means that most of the application logic should be placed within the model while leaving the controller as light as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHTML Over The Wire (Hotwire),[55][56] Conceptual compression,[57][58] and robust security[59] mark Rails 7.0\u0027s approach to the One person framework.[a]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn March 2007, David Heinemeier Hansson applied to register three Ruby on Rails-related trademarks with the USPTO. These applications concern the phrase \"RUBY ON RAILS\",[61] the word \"RAILS\",[62] and the official Rails logo.[63] In the summer of 2007, Hansson denied the publisher Apress permission to use the Ruby on Rails logo on the cover of a new Ruby on Rails book written by some authoritative community members. The episode gave rise to a polite protest in the Ruby on Rails community.[64][65] In response to this criticism, Hansson replied:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only grant promotional use [of the Rails logo] for products I\u0027m directly involved with. Such as books that I\u0027ve been part of the development process for or conferences where I have a say in the execution. I would most definitely seek to enforce all the trademarks of Rails.[64]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trademark of the logo was cancelled on 25 October 2019.[63]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn earlier days, Rails running on Matz\u0027s Ruby Interpreter (the de facto reference interpreter for Ruby) had been criticized for issues with scalability.[66] These critics often mentioned various Twitter outages in 2007 and 2008, which spurred Twitter\u0027s partial transition to Scala (which runs on the Java Virtual Machine) for their queueing system and other middleware.[67][68] The user interface aspects of the site continued to run Ruby on Rails[69] until 2011 when it was replaced due to concerns over performance.[70] On the other hand, many Rails business application developers relied on system architecture design, including choices of database engine, cache configuration, and servers, to tackle scalability issues. The original author of Rails, David Heinemeier Hansson, criticized Twitter, saying that their problems scaling were the consequences of their own poor architectural decisions and not the fault of Rails. According to Hansson, blaming Rails for their troubles while making no contributions to the framework is ungrateful and unjust.[71]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2011, Gartner Research noted that despite criticisms and comparisons to Java, many high-profile consumer web firms are using Ruby on Rails to build scalable web applications. Some of the largest sites running Ruby on Rails include Airbnb, Cookpad, GitHub, GitLab,[72] Scribd, Shopify, and Basecamp.[73] As of January 2016, it is estimated that more than 1.2 million web sites are running Ruby on Rails.[74][75]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn March 2012, security researcher Egor Homakov discovered a mass assignment vulnerability that allowed certain Rails applications to be remotely exploited, and demonstrated it by non-maliciously hacking GitHub after his earlier attempts at responsible disclosure were dismissed.[76]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn 24 September 2013, a session cookie persistence security flaw was reported in Ruby on Rails. In a default configuration, the entire session hash is stored within a session cookie known as CookieStore, allowing any authenticated session possessing the session cookie to log in as the target user at any time in the future. As a workaround, administrators are advised to configure cookies to be stored on the server using mechanisms such as ActiveRecordStore.[77]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers Daniel Jackson and Joseph Near developed a data debugger they called \"Space\" that can analyze the data access of a Rails program and determine if the program properly adheres to rules regarding access restrictions.

Importantly, I would read each chapter carefully, inspect the code provided, and run it to clarify any misunderstandings. Then, what I did was do all of the exercises at the end of each chapter. Even just an hour each day on this, and I was able to finish the book in just a few months. The key here for me was never EVER copy and paste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, I would go pick up Advanced R, again by Hadley Wickham. I don\u0027t necessarily think everyone needs to read every chapter of this book, but at least up through the S3 object system is useful for most people. Again, clarify the code when needed, and do exercises for at least those things which you don\u0027t feel you grasp intuitively yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast, I pick up The R Inferno by Pat Burns. This one is basically all of the minutia on how not to write inefficient or error-prone code. I think this one can be read more selectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing I recommend is to pick a project, and do it. If you don\u0027t know how to use R-projects and Git, then this is the time to learn. If you can\u0027t come up with a project, the thing I\u0027ve liked doing is programming things which already exist. This way, I have source code I can consult to ensure I have things working properly. Then, I would try to improve on the source-code in areas that I think need it.

In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[2][3]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java,[4] Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative programming, procedural programming and functional programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSignificant object-oriented languages include Ada, ActionScript, C++, Common Lisp, C#, Dart, Eiffel, Fortran 2003, Haxe, Java,[4] Kotlin, Logo, MATLAB, Objective-C, Object Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Raku, Ruby, Scala, SIMSCRIPT, Simula, Smalltalk, Swift, Vala and Visual Basic.NET.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerminology invoking \"objects\" in the modern sense of object-oriented programming made its first appearance at the artificial intelligence group at MIT in the late 1950s and early 1960s. \"Object\" referred to LISP atoms with identified properties (attributes).[5][6] Another early MIT example was Sketchpad created by Ivan Sutherland in 1960â1961; in the glossary of the 1963 technical report based on his dissertation about Sketchpad, Sutherland defined notions of \"object\" and \"instance\" (with the class concept covered by \"master\" or \"definition\"), albeit specialized to graphical interaction.[7] Also, in 1968, an MIT ALGOL version, AED-0, established a direct link between data structures (\"plexes\", in that dialect) and procedures, prefiguring what were later termed \"messages\", \"methods\", and \"member functions\".[8][9] Topics such as data abstraction and modular programming were common points of discussion at this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndependently of later MIT work such as AED, Simula was developed during the years 1961â1967.[8] Simula introduced important concepts that are today an essential part of object-oriented programming, such as class and object, inheritance, and dynamic binding.[10] The object-oriented Simula programming language was used mainly by researchers involved with physical modelling, such as models to study and improve the movement of ships and their content through cargo ports.[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages (so messaging came at the very beginning â it took a while to see how to do messaging in a programming language efficiently enough to be useful).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Kay, [1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInfluenced by the work at MIT and the Simula language, in November 1966 Alan Kay began working on ideas that would eventually be incorporated into the Smalltalk programming language. Kay used the term \"object-oriented programming\" in conversation as early as 1967.[1] Although sometimes called \"the father of object-oriented programming\",[11] Alan Kay has differentiated his notion of OO from the more conventional abstract data type notion of object, and has implied that the computer science establishment did not adopt his notion.[1] A 1976 MIT memo co-authored by Barbara Liskov lists Simula 67, CLU, and Alphard as object-oriented languages, but does not mention Smalltalk.[12]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 1970s, the first version of the Smalltalk programming language was developed at Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls and Adele Goldberg. Smalltalk-72 included a programming environment and was dynamically typed, and at first was interpreted, not compiled. Smalltalk became noted for its application of object orientation at the language-level and its graphical development environment. Smalltalk went through various versions and interest in the language grew.[13] While Smalltalk was influenced by the ideas introduced in Simula 67 it was designed to be a fully dynamic system in which classes could be created and modified dynamically.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the late 1970s and 1980s, object-oriented programming rose to prominence. The Flavors object-oriented Lisp was developed starting 1979, introducing multiple inheritance and mixins.[15] In 1981, Goldberg edited the August issue of Byte Magazine, introducing Smalltalk and object-oriented programming to a wide audience.[16] LOOPS, the object system for Interlisp-D, was influenced by Smalltalk and Flavors, and a paper about it was published in 1982.[17] In 1986, the Association for Computing Machinery organized the first Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA), which was attended by 1,000 people. Among other developments was the Common Lisp Object System, which integrates functional programming and object-oriented programming and allows extension via a Meta-object protocol. In the 1980s, there were a few attempts to design processor architectures that included hardware support for objects in memory but these were not successful. Examples include the Intel iAPX 432 and the Linn Smart Rekursiv.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the mid-1980s Objective-C was developed by Brad Cox, who had used Smalltalk at ITT Inc.. Bjarne Stroustrup, who had used Simula for his PhD thesis, created the object-oriented C++.[13] In 1985, Bertrand Meyer also produced the first design of the Eiffel language. Focused on software quality, Eiffel is a purely object-oriented programming language and a notation supporting the entire software lifecycle. Meyer described the Eiffel software development method, based on a small number of key ideas from software engineering and computer science, in Object-Oriented Software Construction. Essential to the quality focus of Eiffel is Meyer\u0027s reliability mechanism, Design by Contract, which is an integral part of both the method and language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the early and mid-1990s object-oriented programming developed as the dominant programming paradigm when programming languages supporting the techniques became widely available. These included Visual FoxPro 3.0,[18][19][20] C++,[21] and Delphi[citation needed]. Its dominance was further enhanced by the rising popularity of graphical user interfaces, which rely heavily upon object-oriented programming techniques. An example of a closely related dynamic GUI library and OOP language can be found in the Cocoa frameworks on Mac OS X, written in Objective-C, an object-oriented, dynamic messaging extension to C based on Smalltalk. OOP toolkits also enhanced the popularity of event-driven programming (although this concept is not limited to OOP).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt ETH ZÃ¼rich, Niklaus Wirth and his colleagues investigated the concept of type checking across module boundaries. Modula-2 (1978) included this concept, and their succeeding design, Oberon (1987), included a distinctive approach to object orientation, classes, and such. Inheritance is not obvious in Wirth\u0027s design since his nomenclature looks in the opposite direction: It is called type extension and the viewpoint is from the parent down to the inheritor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject-oriented features have been added to many previously existing languages, including Ada, BASIC, Fortran, Pascal, and COBOL. Adding these features to languages that were not initially designed for them often led to problems with compatibility and maintainability of code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore recently, some languages have emerged that are primarily object-oriented, but that are also compatible with procedural methodology. Two such languages are Python and Ruby. Probably the most commercially important recent object-oriented languages are Java, developed by Sun Microsystems, as well as C# and Visual Basic.NET (VB.NET), both designed for Microsoft\u0027s .NET platform. Each of these two frameworks shows, in its way, the benefit of using OOP by creating an abstraction from implementation. VB.NET and C# support cross-language inheritance, allowing classes defined in one language to subclass classes defined in the other language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject-oriented programming uses objects, but not all of the associated techniques and structures are supported directly in languages that claim to support OOP. The features listed below are common among languages considered to be strongly class- and object-oriented (or multi-paradigm with OOP support), with notable exceptions mentioned.[22][23][24][25] Christopher J. Date stated that critical comparison of OOP to other technologies, relational in particular, is difficult because of lack of an agreed-upon and rigorous definition of OOP.[26]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModular programming support provides the ability to group procedures into files and modules for organizational purposes. Modules are namespaced so identifiers in one module will not conflict with a procedure or variable sharing the same name in another file or module.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn object is a data structure or abstract data type containing fields (state variables containing data) and methods (subroutines or procedures defining the object\u0027s behavior in code). Fields may also be known as members, attributes, or properties. Objects are typically stored as contiguous regions of memory. Objects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structures, and in many languages are effectively pointers, serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObjects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world.[27] For example, a graphics program may have objects such as \"circle\", \"square\", and \"menu\". An online shopping system might have objects such as \"shopping cart\", \"customer\", and \"product\". Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file, or an object that provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObjects can contain other objects in their instance variables; this is known as object composition. For example, an object in the Employee class might contain (either directly or through a pointer) an object in the Address class, in addition to its own instance variables like \"first_name\" and \"position\". Object composition is used to represent \"has-a\" relationships: every employee has an address, so every Employee object has access to a place to store an Address object (either directly embedded within itself or at a separate location addressed via a pointer). Date and Darwen have proposed a theoretical foundation that uses OOP as a kind of customizable type system to support RDBMS, but it forbids object pointers.[28]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe OOP paradigm has been criticized for overemphasizing the use of objects for software design and modeling at the expense of other important aspects (computation/algorithms).[29][30] For example, Rob Pike has said that OOP languages frequently shift the focus from data structures and algorithms to types.[31] Steve Yegge noted that, as opposed to functional programming:[32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject Oriented Programming puts the nouns first and foremost. Why would you go to such lengths to put one part of speech on a pedestal? Why should one kind of concept take precedence over another? It\u0027s not as if OOP has suddenly made verbs less important in the way we actually think. It\u0027s a strangely skewed perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich Hickey, creator of Clojure, described object systems as overly simplistic models of the real world. He emphasized the inability of OOP to model time properly, which is getting increasingly problematic as software systems become more concurrent.[30]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander Stepanov compares object orientation unfavourably to generic programming:[29]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras â families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting â saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOOP languages are diverse, but typically OOP languages allow inheritance for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. These forms of inheritance are significantly different, but analogous terminology is used to define the concepts of object and instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn class-based programming, the most popular style, each object is required to be an instance of a particular class. The class defines the data format or type (including member variables and their types) and available procedures (class methods or member functions) for a given type or class of object. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a constructor. Classes may inherit from other classes, so they are arranged in a hierarchy that represents \"is-a-type-of\" relationships. For example, class Employee might inherit from class Person. All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names. For example, class Person might define variables \"first_name\" and \"last_name\" with method \"make_full_name()\". These will also be available in class Employee, which might add the variables \"position\" and \"salary\". It is guaranteed that all instances of class Employee will have the same variables, such as the name, position, and salary. Procedures and variables can be specific to either the class or the instance; this leads to the following terms:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on the definition of the language, subclasses may or may not be able to override the methods defined by superclasses. Multiple inheritance is allowed in some languages, though this can make resolving overrides complicated. Some languages have special support for other concepts like traits and mixins, though, in any language with multiple inheritance, a mixin is simply a class that does not represent an is-a-type-of relationship. Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes. For example, class UnicodeConversionMixin might provide a method unicode_to_ascii() when included in class FileReader and class WebPageScraper, which do not share a common parent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbstract classes cannot be instantiated into objects; they exist only for inheritance into other \"concrete\" classes that can be instantiated. In Java, the final keyword can be used to prevent a class from being subclassed.[33]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, in prototype-based programming, objects are the primary entities. Generally, the concept of a \"class\" does not even exist. Rather, the prototype or parent of an object is just another object to which the object is linked. In Self, an object may have multiple or no parents,[34] but in the most popular prototype-based language, Javascript, every object has one prototype link (and only one). New objects can be created based on already existing objects chosen as their prototype. You may call two different objects apple and orange a fruit if the object fruit exists, and both apple and orange have fruit as their prototype. The idea of the fruit class does not exist explicitly, but can be modeled as the equivalence class of the objects sharing the same prototype, or as the set of objects satisfying a certain interface (duck typing). Unlike class-based programming, it is typically possible in prototype-based languages to define attributes and methods not shared with other objects; for example, the attribute sugar_content may be defined in apple but not orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctrine of composition over inheritance advocates implementing has-a relationships using composition instead of inheritance. For example, instead of inheriting from class Person, class Employee could give each Employee object an internal Person object, which it then has the opportunity to hide from external code even if class Person has many public attributes or methods. Some languages like Go do not support inheritance at all. Go states that it is object-oriented,[35] and Bjarne Stroustrup, author of C++, has stated that it is possible to do OOP without inheritance.[36] Delegation is another language feature that can be used as an alternative to inheritance. Rob Pike has called object-oriented programming \"the Roman numerals of computing\"[37] and cites an instance of a Java professor whose \"idiomatic\" solution to a problem was to create six new classes, rather than to simply use a lookup table.[38]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob Martin states that because they are software, related classes do not necessarily share the relationships of the things they represent.[39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the responsibility of the object, not any external code, to select the procedural code to execute in response to a method call, typically by looking up the method at run time in a table associated with the object. This feature is known as dynamic dispatch. If the call variability relies on more than the single type of the object on which it is called (i.e. at least one other parameter object is involved in the method choice), one speaks of multiple dispatch. A method call is also known as message passing. It is conceptualized as a message (the name of the method and its input parameters) being passed to the object for dispatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDispatch interacts with inheritance; if a method is not present in a given object or class, the dispatch is delegated to its parent object or class, and so on, going up the chain of inheritance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData abstraction is a design pattern in which data are visible only to semantically related functions, to prevent misuse. The success of data abstraction leads to frequent incorporation of data hiding as a design principle in object-oriented and pure functional programming. Similarly, encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object. This facilitates code refactoring, for example allowing the author of the class to change how objects of that class represent their data internally without changing any external code (as long as \"public\" method calls work the same way). It also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers. Encapsulation is a technique that encourages decoupling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn object oriented programming, objects provide a layer which can be used to separate internal from external code and implement abstraction and encapsulation. External code can only use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, reading an instance variable, or writing to an instance variable. A program may create many instances of objects as it runs, which operate independently. This technique, it is claimed, allows easy re-use of the same procedures and data definitions for different sets of data, in addition to potentially mirroring real-world relationships intuitively. Rather than utilizing database tables and programming subroutines, the developer utilizes objects the user may be more familiar with: objects from their application domain.[40] These claims that the OOP paradigm enhances reusability and modularity have been criticized.[41][42]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a class does not allow calling code to access internal object data and permits access through methods only, this is also a form of information hiding. Some languages (Java, for example) let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly, for example, denoting internal data with the private keyword and designating methods intended for use by code outside the class with the public keyword.[43] Methods may also be designed public, private, or intermediate levels such as protected (which allows access from the same class and its subclasses, but not objects of a different class).[43] In other languages (like Python) this is enforced only by convention (for example, private methods may have names that start with an underscore). In C#, Swift \u0026 Kotlin languages, internal keyword permits access only to files present in the same assembly, package, or module as that of the class.[44]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn programming languages, particularly object-oriented ones, the emphasis on abstraction is vital. Object-oriented languages extend the notion of type to incorporate data abstraction, highlighting the significance of restricting access to internal data through methods.[45] Eric S. Raymond has written that object-oriented programming languages tend to encourage thickly layered programs that destroy transparency.[46] Raymond compares this unfavourably to the approach taken with Unix and the C programming language.[46]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"open/closed principle\" advocates that classes and functions \"should be open for extension, but closed for modification\". Luca Cardelli has claimed that OOP languages have \"extremely poor modularity properties with respect to class extension and modification\", and tend to be extremely complex.[41] The latter point is reiterated by Joe Armstrong, the principal inventor of Erlang, who is quoted as saying:[42]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with object-oriented languages is they\u0027ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo Brodie has suggested a connection between the standalone nature of objects and a tendency to duplicate code[47] in violation of the don\u0027t repeat yourself principle[48] of software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubtyping â a form of polymorphism â is when calling code can be independent of which class in the supported hierarchy it is operating on â the parent class or one of its descendants. Meanwhile, the same operation name among objects in an inheritance hierarchy may behave differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, objects of the type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape. The Draw function for each type of Shape implements what is necessary to draw itself while calling code can remain indifferent to the particular type of Shape being drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is another type of abstraction that simplifies code external to the class hierarchy and enables strong separation of concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA common feature of objects is that methods are attached to them and can access and modify the object\u0027s data fields. In this brand of OOP, there is usually a special name such as this or self used to refer to the current object. In languages that support open recursion, object methods can call other methods on the same object (including themselves) using this name. This variable is late-bound; it allows a method defined in one class to invoke another method that is defined later, in some subclass thereof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimula (1967) is generally accepted as being the first language with the primary features of an object-oriented language. It was created for making simulation programs, in which what came to be called objects were the most important information representation. Smalltalk (1972 to 1980) is another early example and the one with which much of the theory of OOP was developed. Concerning the degree of object orientation, the following distinctions can be made:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany widely used languages, such as C++, Java, and Python, provide object-oriented features. Although in the past object-oriented programming was widely accepted,[50] more recently essays criticizing object-oriented programming and recommending the avoidance of these features (generally in favor of functional programming) have been very popular in the developer community.[51] Paul Graham has suggested that OOP\u0027s popularity within large companies is due to \"large (and frequently changing) groups of mediocre programmers\". According to Graham, the discipline imposed by OOP prevents any one programmer from \"doing too much damage\".[52] Eric S. Raymond, a Unix programmer and open-source software advocate, has been critical of claims that present object-oriented programming as the \"One True Solution\".[46]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Feldman argues that these languages may have improved their modularity by adding OO features, but they became popular for reasons other than being object-oriented.[53] In an article, Lawrence Krubner claimed that compared to other languages (LISP dialects, functional languages, etc.) OOP languages have no unique strengths, and inflict a heavy burden of unneeded complexity.[54] A study by Potok et al. has shown no significant difference in productivity between OOP and procedural approaches.[55] Luca Cardelli has claimed that OOP code is \"intrinsically less efficient\" than procedural code and that OOP can take longer to compile.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, object-oriented programming has become especially popular in dynamic programming languages. Python, PowerShell, Ruby and Groovy are dynamic languages built on OOP principles, while Perl and PHP have been adding object-oriented features since Perl 5 and PHP 4, and ColdFusion since version 6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Document Object Model of HTML, XHTML, and XML documents on the Internet has bindings to the popular JavaScript/ECMAScript language. JavaScript is perhaps the best known prototype-based programming language, which employs cloning from prototypes rather than inheriting from a class (contrast to class-based programming). Another scripting language that takes this approach is Lua.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe messages that flow between computers to request services in a client-server environment can be designed as the linearizations of objects defined by class objects known to both the client and the server. For example, a simple linearized object would consist of a length field, a code point identifying the class, and a data value. A more complex example would be a command consisting of the length and code point of the command and values consisting of linearized objects representing the command\u0027s parameters. Each such command must be directed by the server to an object whose class (or superclass) recognizes the command and can provide the requested service. Clients and servers are best modeled as complex object-oriented structures. Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDM) took this approach and used class objects to define objects at four levels of a formal hierarchy:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe initial version of DDM defined distributed file services. It was later extended to be the foundation of Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChallenges of object-oriented design are addressed by several approaches. The most common is known as the design patterns codified by Gamma et al.. More broadly, the term \"design patterns\" can be used to refer to any general, repeatable, solution pattern to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some of these commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions particular to object-oriented development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is intuitive to assume that inheritance creates a semantic \"is a\" relationship, and thus to infer that objects instantiated from subclasses can always be safely used instead of those instantiated from the superclass. This intuition is unfortunately false in most OOP languages, in particular in all those that allow mutable objects. Subtype polymorphism as enforced by the type checker in OOP languages (with mutable objects) cannot guarantee behavioral subtyping in any context. Behavioral subtyping is undecidable in general, so it cannot be implemented by a program (compiler). Class or object hierarchies must be carefully designed, considering possible incorrect uses that cannot be detected syntactically. This issue is known as the Liskov substitution principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesign Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software is an influential book published in 1994 by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, often referred to humorously as the \"Gang of Four\". Along with exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, it describes 23 common programming problems and patterns for solving them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book describes the following patterns:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth object-oriented programming and relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are extremely common in software today[update]. Since relational databases do not store objects directly (though some RDBMSs have object-oriented features to approximate this), there is a general need to bridge the two worlds. The problem of bridging object-oriented programming accesses and data patterns with relational databases is known as object-relational impedance mismatch. There are some approaches to cope with this problem, but no general solution without downsides.[56] One of the most common approaches is object-relational mapping, as found in IDE languages such as Visual FoxPro and libraries such as Java Data Objects and Ruby on Rails\u0027 ActiveRecord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also object databases that can be used to replace RDBMSs, but these have not been as technically and commercially successful as RDBMSs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOOP can be used to associate real-world objects and processes with digital counterparts. However, not everyone agrees that OOP facilitates direct real-world mapping or that real-world mapping is even a worthy goal; Bertrand Meyer argues in Object-Oriented Software Construction[57] that a program is not a model of the world but a model of some part of the world; \"Reality is a cousin twice removed\". At the same time, some principal limitations of OOP have been noted.[58] For example, the circle-ellipse problem is difficult to handle using OOP\u0027s concept of inheritance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Niklaus Wirth (who popularized the adage now known as Wirth\u0027s law: \"Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster\") said of OOP in his paper, \"Good Ideas through the Looking Glass\", \"This paradigm closely reflects the structure of systems \u0027in the real world\u0027, and it is therefore well suited to model complex systems with complex behaviors\"[59] (contrast KISS principle).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve Yegge and others noted that natural languages lack the OOP approach of strictly prioritizing things (objects/nouns) before actions (methods/verbs).[60] This problem may cause OOP to suffer more convoluted solutions than procedural programming.[61]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOOP was developed to increase the reusability and maintainability of source code.[62] Transparent representation of the control flow had no priority and was meant to be handled by a compiler. With the increasing relevance of parallel hardware and multithreaded coding, developing transparent control flow becomes more important, something hard to achieve with OOP.[63][64][65][66]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResponsibility-driven design defines classes in terms of a contract, that is, a class should be defined around a responsibility and the information that it shares. This is contrasted by Wirfs-Brock and Wilkerson with data-driven design, where classes are defined around the data-structures that must be held. The authors hold that responsibility-driven design is preferable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSOLID is a mnemonic invented by Michael Feathers which spells out five software engineering design principles:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) is another set of guidelines advocated by Craig Larman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObjects are the run-time entities in an object-oriented system. They may represent a person, a place, a bank account, a table of data, or any item that the program has to handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere have been several attempts at formalizing the concepts used in object-oriented programming. The following concepts and constructs have been used as interpretations of OOP concepts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttempts to find a consensus definition or theory behind objects have not proven very successful (however, see Abadi \u0026 Cardelli, A Theory of Objects[68] for formal definitions of many OOP concepts and constructs), and often diverge widely. For example, some definitions focus on mental activities, and some on program structuring. One of the simpler definitions is that OOP is the act of using \"map\" data structures or arrays that can contain functions and pointers to other maps, all with some syntactic and scoping sugar on top. Inheritance can be performed by cloning the maps (sometimes called \"prototyping\").\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language","html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn computer programming, assembly language (alternatively assembler language[1] or symbolic machine code),[2][3][4] often referred to simply as assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture\u0027s machine code instructions.[5] Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but constants, comments, assembler directives,[6] symbolic labels of, e.g., memory locations, registers, and macros[7][1] are generally also supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth\u0027s 1947 work, Coding for A.R.C..[8] Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. The term \"assembler\" is generally attributed to Wilkes, Wheeler and Gill in their 1951 book The Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer,[9] who, however, used the term to mean \"a program that assembles another program consisting of several sections into a single program\".[10] The conversion process is referred to as assembly, as in assembling the source code. The computational step when an assembler is processing a program is called assembly time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause assembly depends on the machine code instructions, each assembly language[nb 1] is specific to a particular computer architecture.[11][12][13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes there is more than one assembler for the same architecture, and sometimes an assembler is specific to an operating system or to particular operating systems. Most assembly languages do not provide specific syntax for operating system calls, and most assembly languages can be used universally with any operating system,[nb 2] as the language provides access to all the real capabilities of the processor, upon which all system call mechanisms ultimately rest. In contrast to assembly languages, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling, much more complicated tasks than assembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first decades of computing, it was commonplace for both systems programming and application programming to take place entirely in assembly language. While still irreplaceable for some purposes, the majority of programming is now conducted in higher-level interpreted and compiled languages. In \"No Silver Bullet\", Fred Brooks summarised the effects of the switch away from assembly language programming: \"Surely the most powerful stroke for software productivity, reliability, and simplicity has been the progressive use of high-level languages for programming. Most observers credit that development with at least a factor of five in productivity, and with concomitant gains in reliability, simplicity, and comprehensibility.\"[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, it is typical to use small amounts of assembly language code within larger systems implemented in a higher-level language, for performance reasons or to interact directly with hardware in ways unsupported by the higher-level language. For instance, just under 2% of version 4.9 of the Linux kernel source code is written in assembly; more than 97% is written in C.[15]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly language uses a mnemonic to represent, e.g., each low-level machine instruction or opcode, each directive, typically also each architectural register, flag, etc. Some of the mnemonics may be built in and some user defined. Many operations require one or more operands in order to form a complete instruction. Most assemblers permit named constants, registers, and labels for program and memory locations, and can calculate expressions for operands. Thus, programmers are freed from tedious repetitive calculations and assembler programs are much more readable than machine code. Depending on the architecture, these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or addressing modes using offsets or other data as well as fixed addresses. Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the assembly process, and to aid debugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome are column oriented, with specific fields in specific columns; this was very common for machines using punched cards in the 1950s and early 1960s. Some assemblers have free-form syntax, with fields separated by delimiters, e.g., punctuation, white space. Some assemblers are hybrid, with, e.g., labels, in a specific column and other fields separated by delimiters; this became more common than column oriented syntax in the 1960s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn assembler program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents. This representation typically includes an operation code (\"opcode\") as well as other control bits and data. The assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities.[20] The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution â e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline, instead of called subroutines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of instruction set-specific optimizations. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x86 assemblers from various vendors. Called jump-sizing,[20] most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for RISC architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the CPU pipeline as efficiently as possible.[21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssemblers have been available since the 1950s, as the first step above machine language and before high-level programming languages such as Fortran, Algol, COBOL and Lisp. There have also been several classes of translators and semi-automatic code generators with properties similar to both assembly and high-level languages, with Speedcode as perhaps one of the better-known examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere may be several assemblers with different syntax for a particular CPU or instruction set architecture. For instance, an instruction to add memory data to a register in a x86-family processor might be add eax,[ebx], in original Intel syntax, whereas this would be written addl (%ebx),%eax in the AT\u0026T syntax used by the GNU Assembler. Despite different appearances, different syntactic forms generally generate the same numeric machine code. A single assembler may also have different modes in order to support variations in syntactic forms as well as their exact semantic interpretations (such as FASM-syntax, TASM-syntax, ideal mode, etc., in the special case of x86 assembly programming).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two types of assemblers based on how many passes through the source are needed (how many times the assembler reads the source) to produce the object file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn both cases, the assembler must be able to determine the size of each instruction on the initial passes in order to calculate the addresses of subsequent symbols. This means that if the size of an operation referring to an operand defined later depends on the type or distance of the operand, the assembler will make a pessimistic estimate when first encountering the operation, and if necessary, pad it with one or more \"no-operation\" instructions in a later pass or the errata. In an assembler with peephole optimization, addresses may be recalculated between passes to allow replacing pessimistic code with code tailored to the exact distance from the target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original reason for the use of one-pass assemblers was memory size and speed of assembly â often a second pass would require storing the symbol table in memory (to handle forward references), rewinding and rereading the program source on tape, or rereading a deck of cards or punched paper tape. Later computers with much larger memories (especially disc storage), had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re-reading. The advantage of the multi-pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the linking process (or the program load if the assembler directly produces executable code) faster.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExample: in the following code snippet, a one-pass assembler would be able to determine the address of the backward reference BKWD when assembling statement S2, but would not be able to determine the address of the forward reference FWD when assembling the branch statement S1; indeed, FWD may be undefined. A two-pass assembler would determine both addresses in pass 1, so they would be known when generating code in pass 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore sophisticated high-level assemblers provide language abstractions such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee Language design below for more details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA program written in assembly language consists of a series of mnemonic processor instructions and meta-statements (known variously as declarative operations, directives, pseudo-instructions, pseudo-operations and pseudo-ops), comments and data. Assembly language instructions usually consist of an opcode mnemonic followed by an operand, which might be a list of data, arguments or parameters.[24] Some instructions may be \"implied\", which means the data upon which the instruction operates is implicitly defined by the instruction itselfâsuch an instruction does not take an operand. The resulting statement is translated by an assembler into machine language instructions that can be loaded into memory and executed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the instruction below tells an x86/IA-32 processor to move an immediate 8-bit value into a register. The binary code for this instruction is 10110 followed by a 3-bit identifier for which register to use. The identifier for the AL register is 000, so the following machine code loads the AL register with the data 01100001.[24]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis binary computer code can be made more human-readable by expressing it in hexadecimal as follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, B0 means \u0027Move a copy of the following value into AL, and 61 is a hexadecimal representation of the value 01100001, which is 97 in decimal. Assembly language for the 8086 family provides the mnemonic MOV (an abbreviation of move) for instructions such as this, so the machine code above can be written as follows in assembly language, complete with an explanatory comment if required, after the semicolon. This is much easier to read and to remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn some assembly languages (including this one) the same mnemonic, such as MOV, may be used for a family of related instructions for loading, copying and moving data, whether these are immediate values, values in registers, or memory locations pointed to by values in registers or by immediate (a.k.a. direct) addresses. Other assemblers may use separate opcode mnemonics such as L for \"move memory to register\", ST for \"move register to memory\", LR for \"move register to register\", MVI for \"move immediate operand to memory\", etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the same mnemonic is used for different instructions, that means that the mnemonic corresponds to several different binary instruction codes, excluding data (e.g. the 61h in this example), depending on the operands that follow the mnemonic. For example, for the x86/IA-32 CPUs, the Intel assembly language syntax MOV AL, AH represents an instruction that moves the contents of register AH into register AL. The[nb 3] hexadecimal form of this instruction is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first byte, 88h, identifies a move between a byte-sized register and either another register or memory, and the second byte, E0h, is encoded (with three bit-fields) to specify that both operands are registers, the source is AH, and the destination is AL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a case like this where the same mnemonic can represent more than one binary instruction, the assembler determines which instruction to generate by examining the operands. In the first example, the operand 61h is a valid hexadecimal numeric constant and is not a valid register name, so only the B0 instruction can be applicable. In the second example, the operand AH is a valid register name and not a valid numeric constant (hexadecimal, decimal, octal, or binary), so only the 88 instruction can be applicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly languages are always designed so that this sort of lack of ambiguity is universally enforced by their syntax. For example, in the Intel x86 assembly language, a hexadecimal constant must start with a numeral digit, so that the hexadecimal number \u0027A\u0027 (equal to decimal ten) would be written as 0Ah or 0AH, not AH, specifically so that it cannot appear to be the name of register AH. (The same rule also prevents ambiguity with the names of registers BH, CH, and DH, as well as with any user-defined symbol that ends with the letter H and otherwise contains only characters that are hexadecimal digits, such as the word \"BEACH\".)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to the original example, while the x86 opcode 10110000 (B0) copies an 8-bit value into the AL register, 10110001 (B1) moves it into CL and 10110010 (B2) does so into DL. Assembly language examples for these follow.[24]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe syntax of MOV can also be more complex as the following examples show.[25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn each case, the MOV mnemonic is translated directly into one of the opcodes 88-8C, 8E, A0-A3, B0-BF, C6 or C7 by an assembler, and the programmer normally does not have to know or remember which.[24]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransforming assembly language into machine code is the job of an assembler, and the reverse can at least partially be achieved by a disassembler. Unlike high-level languages, there is a one-to-one correspondence between many simple assembly statements and machine language instructions. However, in some cases, an assembler may provide pseudoinstructions (essentially macros) which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality. For example, for a machine that lacks a \"branch if greater or equal\" instruction, an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machine\u0027s \"set if less than\" and \"branch if zero (on the result of the set instruction)\". Most full-featured assemblers also provide a rich macro language (discussed below) which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences. Since the information about pseudoinstructions and macros defined in the assembler environment is not present in the object program, a disassembler cannot reconstruct the macro and pseudoinstruction invocations but can only disassemble the actual machine instructions that the assembler generated from those abstract assembly-language entities. Likewise, since comments in the assembly language source file are ignored by the assembler and have no effect on the object code it generates, a disassembler is always completely unable to recover source comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach computer architecture has its own machine language. Computers differ in the number and type of operations they support, in the different sizes and numbers of registers, and in the representations of data in storage. While most general-purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality, the ways they do so differ; the corresponding assembly languages reflect these differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMultiple sets of mnemonics or assembly-language syntax may exist for a single instruction set, typically instantiated in different assembler programs. In these cases, the most popular one is usually that supplied by the CPU manufacturer and used in its documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo examples of CPUs that have two different sets of mnemonics are the Intel 8080 family and the Intel 8086/8088. Because Intel claimed copyright on its assembly language mnemonics (on each page of their documentation published in the 1970s and early 1980s, at least), some companies that independently produced CPUs compatible with Intel instruction sets invented their own mnemonics. The Zilog Z80 CPU, an enhancement of the Intel 8080A, supports all the 8080A instructions plus many more; Zilog invented an entirely new assembly language, not only for the new instructions but also for all of the 8080A instructions. For example, where Intel uses the mnemonics MOV, MVI, LDA, STA, LXI, LDAX, STAX, LHLD, and SHLD for various data transfer instructions, the Z80 assembly language uses the mnemonic LD for all of them. A similar case is the NEC V20 and V30 CPUs, enhanced copies of the Intel 8086 and 8088, respectively. Like Zilog with the Z80, NEC invented new mnemonics for all of the 8086 and 8088 instructions, to avoid accusations of infringement of Intel\u0027s copyright. (It is questionable whether such copyrights can be valid, and later CPU companies such as AMD[nb 4] and Cyrix republished Intel\u0027s x86/IA-32 instruction mnemonics exactly with neither permission nor legal penalty.) It is doubtful whether in practice many people who programmed the V20 and V30 actually wrote in NEC\u0027s assembly language rather than Intel\u0027s; since any two assembly languages for the same instruction set architecture are isomorphic (somewhat like English and Pig Latin), there is no requirement to use a manufacturer\u0027s own published assembly language with that manufacturer\u0027s products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemblers categorize statements and in the nomenclature that they use. In particular, some describe anything other than a machine mnemonic or extended mnemonic as a pseudo-operation (pseudo-op). A typical assembly language consists of 3 types of instruction statements that are used to define program operations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstructions (statements) in assembly language are generally very simple, unlike those in high-level languages. Generally, a mnemonic is a symbolic name for a single executable machine language instruction (an opcode), and there is at least one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction. Each instruction typically consists of an operation or opcode plus zero or more operands. Most instructions refer to a single value or a pair of values. Operands can be immediate (value coded in the instruction itself), registers specified in the instruction or implied, or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage. This is determined by the underlying processor architecture: the assembler merely reflects how this architecture works. Extended mnemonics are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand, e.g., the System/360 assemblers use B as an extended mnemonic for BC with a mask of 15 and NOP (\"NO OPeration\" â do nothing for one step) for BC with a mask of 0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtended mnemonics are often used to support specialized uses of instructions, often for purposes not obvious from the instruction name. For example, many CPU\u0027s do not have an explicit NOP instruction, but do have instructions that can be used for the purpose. In 8086 CPUs the instruction xchg ax,ax is used for nop, with nop being a pseudo-opcode to encode the instruction xchg ax,ax. Some disassemblers recognize this and will decode the xchg ax,ax instruction as nop. Similarly, IBM assemblers for System/360 and System/370 use the extended mnemonics NOP and NOPR for BC and BCR with zero masks. For the SPARC architecture, these are known as synthetic instructions.[26]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome assemblers also support simple built-in macro-instructions that generate two or more machine instructions. For instance, with some Z80 assemblers the instruction ld hl,bc is recognized to generate ld l,c followed by ld h,b.[27] These are sometimes known as pseudo-opcodes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMnemonics are arbitrary symbols; in 1985 the IEEE published Standard 694 for a uniform set of mnemonics to be used by all assemblers. The standard has since been withdrawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are instructions used to define data elements to hold data and variables. They define the type of data, the length and the alignment of data. These instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs (programs assembled separately) or only to the program in which the data section is defined. Some assemblers classify these as pseudo-ops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly directives, also called pseudo-opcodes, pseudo-operations or pseudo-ops, are commands given to an assembler \"directing it to perform operations other than assembling instructions\".[20] Directives affect how the assembler operates and \"may affect the object code, the symbol table, the listing file, and the values of internal assembler parameters\". Sometimes the term pseudo-opcode is reserved for directives that generate object code, such as those that generate data.[28]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe names of pseudo-ops often start with a dot to distinguish them from machine instructions. Pseudo-ops can make the assembly of the program dependent on parameters input by a programmer, so that one program can be assembled in different ways, perhaps for different applications. Or, a pseudo-op can be used to manipulate presentation of a program to make it easier to read and maintain. Another common use of pseudo-ops is to reserve storage areas for run-time data and optionally initialize their contents to known values.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSymbolic assemblers let programmers associate arbitrary names (labels or symbols) with memory locations and various constants. Usually, every constant and variable is given a name so instructions can reference those locations by name, thus promoting self-documenting code. In executable code, the name of each subroutine is associated with its entry point, so any calls to a subroutine can use its name. Inside subroutines, GOTO destinations are given labels. Some assemblers support local symbols which are often lexically distinct from normal symbols (e.g., the use of \"10$\" as a GOTO destination).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome assemblers, such as NASM, provide flexible symbol management, letting programmers manage different namespaces, automatically calculate offsets within data structures, and assign labels that refer to literal values or the result of simple computations performed by the assembler. Labels can also be used to initialize constants and variables with relocatable addresses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly languages, like most other computer languages, allow comments to be added to program source code that will be ignored during assembly. Judicious commenting is essential in assembly language programs, as the meaning and purpose of a sequence of binary machine instructions can be difficult to determine. The \"raw\" (uncommented) assembly language generated by compilers or disassemblers is quite difficult to read when changes must be made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany assemblers support predefined macros, and others support programmer-defined (and repeatedly re-definable) macros involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constants are embedded. The macro definition is most commonly[nb 5] a mixture of assembler statements, e.g., directives, symbolic machine instructions, and templates for assembler statements. This sequence of text lines may include opcodes or directives. Once a macro has been defined its name may be used in place of a mnemonic. When the assembler processes such a statement, it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro, then processes them as if they existed in the source code file (including, in some assemblers, expansion of any macros existing in the replacement text). Macros in this sense date to IBM autocoders of the 1950s.[29]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacro assemblers typically have directives to, e.g., define macros, define variables, set variables to the result of an arithmetic, logical or string expression, iterate, conditionally generate code. Some of those directives may be restricted to use within a macro definition, e.g., MEXIT in HLASM, while others may be permitted within open code (outside macro definitions), e.g., AIF and COPY in HLASM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn assembly language, the term \"macro\" represents a more comprehensive concept than it does in some other contexts, such as the pre-processor in the C programming language, where its #define directive typically is used to create short single line macros. Assembler macro instructions, like macros in PL/I and some other languages, can be lengthy \"programs\" by themselves, executed by interpretation by the assembler during assembly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince macros can have \u0027short\u0027 names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code, they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter, requiring fewer lines of source code, as with higher level languages. They can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs, optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameters and other similar features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacro assemblers often allow macros to take parameters. Some assemblers include quite sophisticated macro languages, incorporating such high-level language elements as optional parameters, symbolic variables, conditionals, string manipulation, and arithmetic operations, all usable during the execution of a given macro, and allowing macros to save context or exchange information. Thus a macro might generate numerous assembly language instructions or data definitions, based on the macro arguments. This could be used to generate record-style data structures or \"unrolled\" loops, for example, or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters. For instance, a \"sort\" macro could accept the specification of a complex sort key and generate code crafted for that specific key, not needing the run-time tests that would be required for a general procedure interpreting the specification. An organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher-level language since such programmers are not working with a computer\u0027s lowest-level conceptual elements. Underlining this point, macros were used to implement an early virtual machine in SNOBOL4 (1967), which was written in the SNOBOL Implementation Language (SIL), an assembly language for a virtual machine. The target machine would translate this to its native code using a macro assembler.[30] This allowed a high degree of portability for the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacros were used to customize large scale software systems for specific customers in the mainframe era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers\u0027 needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems. This was done, for example, by systems programmers working with IBM\u0027s Conversational Monitor System / Virtual Machine (VM/CMS) and with IBM\u0027s \"real time transaction processing\" add-ons, Customer Information Control System CICS, and ACP/TPF, the airline/financial system that began in the 1970s and still runs many large computer reservation systems (CRS) and credit card systems today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages, for example, to generate a version of a program in COBOL using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of COBOL code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code. IBM OS/360 uses macros to perform system generation. The user specifies options by coding a series of assembler macros. Assembling these macros generates a job stream to build the system, including job control language and utility control statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is because, as was realized in the 1960s, the concept of \"macro processing\" is independent of the concept of \"assembly\", the former being in modern terms more word processing, text processing, than generating object code. The concept of macro processing appeared, and appears, in the C programming language, which supports \"preprocessor instructions\" to set variables, and make conditional tests on their values. Unlike certain previous macro processors inside assemblers, the C preprocessor is not Turing-complete because it lacks the ability to either loop or \"go to\", the latter allowing programs to loop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the power of macro processing, it fell into disuse in many high level languages (major exceptions being C, C++ and PL/I) while remaining a perennial for assemblers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacro parameter substitution is strictly by name: at macro processing time, the value of a parameter is textually substituted for its name. The most famous class of bugs resulting was the use of a parameter that itself was an expression and not a simple name when the macro writer expected a name. In the macro:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe intention was that the caller would provide the name of a variable, and the \"global\" variable or constant b would be used to multiply \"a\". If foo is called with the parameter a-c, the macro expansion of load a-c*b occurs. To avoid any possible ambiguity, users of macro processors can parenthesize formal parameters inside macro definitions, or callers can parenthesize the input parameters.[31]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePackages of macros have been written providing structured programming elements to encode execution flow. The earliest example of this approach was in the Concept-14 macro set,[32] originally proposed by Harlan Mills (March 1970), and implemented by Marvin Kessler at IBM\u0027s Federal Systems Division, which provided IF/ELSE/ENDIF and similar control flow blocks for OS/360 assembler programs. This was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of GOTO operations in assembly code, one of the main factors causing spaghetti code in assembly language. This approach was widely accepted in the early 1980s (the latter days of large-scale assembly language use). IBM\u0027s High Level Assembler Toolkit[33] includes such a macro package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA curious design was A-Natural, a \"stream-oriented\" assembler for 8080/Z80, processors[34] from Whitesmiths Ltd. (developers of the Unix-like Idris operating system, and what was reported to be the first commercial C compiler). The language was classified as an assembler because it worked with raw machine elements such as opcodes, registers, and memory references; but it incorporated an expression syntax to indicate execution order. Parentheses and other special symbols, along with block-oriented structured programming constructs, controlled the sequence of the generated instructions. A-natural was built as the object language of a C compiler, rather than for hand-coding, but its logical syntax won some fans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large-scale assembly language development.[35] In spite of that, they are still being developed and applied in cases where resource constraints or peculiarities in the target system\u0027s architecture prevent the effective use of higher-level languages.[36]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssemblers with a strong macro engine allow structured programming via macros, such as the switch macro provided with the Masm32 package (this code is a complete program):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly languages were not available at the time when the stored-program computer was introduced. Kathleen Booth \"is credited with inventing assembly language\"[37][38] based on theoretical work she began in 1947, while working on the ARC2 at Birkbeck, University of London following consultation by Andrew Booth (later her husband) with mathematician John von Neumann and physicist Herman Goldstine at the Institute for Advanced Study.[38][39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn late 1948, the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) had an assembler (named \"initial orders\") integrated into its bootstrap program. It used one-letter mnemonics developed by David Wheeler, who is credited by the IEEE Computer Society as the creator of the first \"assembler\".[20][40][41] Reports on the EDSAC introduced the term \"assembly\" for the process of combining fields into an instruction word.[42] SOAP (Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program) was an assembly language for the IBM 650 computer written by Stan Poley in 1955.[43]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly languages eliminate much of the error-prone, tedious, and time-consuming first-generation programming needed with the earliest computers, freeing programmers from tedium such as remembering numeric codes and calculating addresses. They were once widely used for all sorts of programming. However, by the late 1950s,[44] their use had largely been supplanted by higher-level languages, in the search for improved programming productivity.[citation needed] Today, assembly language is still used for direct hardware manipulation, access to specialized processor instructions, or to address critical performance issues.[45] Typical uses are device drivers, low-level embedded systems, and real-time systems (see Â§ Current usage).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerous programs have been written entirely in assembly language. The Burroughs MCP (1961) was the first computer for which an operating system was not developed entirely in assembly language; it was written in Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language (ESPOL), an Algol dialect. Many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well, including a large amount of the IBM mainframe software written by large corporations. COBOL, FORTRAN and some PL/I eventually displaced much of this work, although a number of large organizations retained assembly-language application infrastructures well into the 1990s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly language has long been the primary development language for 8-bit home computers such as the Atari 8-bits, Apple II, MSX, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64. Interpreted BASIC dialects on these systems offer insufficient execution speed and insufficient facilities to take full advantage of the available hardware. These systems have severe resource constraints, idiosyncratic memory and display architectures, and provide limited system services. There are also few high-level language compilers suitable for microcomputer use. Similarly, assembly language is the default choice for 8-bit consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKey software for IBM PC compatibles was written in assembly language, such as MS-DOS, Turbo Pascal, and the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet. As computer speed grew exponentially, assembly language became a tool for speeding up parts of programs, such as the rendering of Doom, rather than a dominant development language. In the 1990s, assembly language was used to get performance out of systems such as the Sega Saturn[46] and as the primary language for arcade hardware based on the TMS34010 integrated CPU/GPU such as Mortal Kombat and NBA Jam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere has been debate over the usefulness and performance of assembly language relative to high-level languages.[47]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important (see below), there are other tools for optimization.[48]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of July 2017[update], the TIOBE index of programming language popularity ranks assembly language at 11, ahead of Visual Basic, for example.[49] Assembler can be used to optimize for speed or optimize for size. In the case of speed optimization, modern optimizing compilers are claimed[50] to render high-level languages into code that can run as fast as hand-written assembly, despite the counter-examples that can be found.[51][52][53] The complexity of modern processors and memory sub-systems makes effective optimization increasingly difficult for compilers, as well as for assembly programmers.[54][55] Moreover, increasing processor performance has meant that most CPUs sit idle most of the time,[56] with delays caused by predictable bottlenecks such as cache misses, I/O operations and paging. This has made raw code execution speed a non-issue for many programmers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some situations in which developers might choose to use assembly language:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly language is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs. Although few programmers today regularly work with assembly language as a tool, the underlying concepts remain important. Such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic, memory allocation, stack processing, character set encoding, interrupt processing, and compiler design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level. Since a computer\u0027s behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set, the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language. Most modern computers have similar instruction sets. Therefore, studying a single assembly language is sufficient to learn: I) the basic concepts; II) to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate; and III) to see how efficient executable code can be created from high-level languages.[23]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)","html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango (/ËdÊÃ¦ÅÉ¡oÊ/ JANG-goh; sometimes stylized as django)[6] is a free and open-source, Python-based web framework that runs on a web server. It follows the modelâtemplateâviews (MTV) architectural pattern.[7][8] It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established in the US as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango\u0027s primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and \"pluggability\" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don\u0027t repeat yourself.[9] Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome well-known sites that use Django includes Instagram,[10] Mozilla,[11] Disqus,[12] Bitbucket,[13] Nextdoor[14] and Clubhouse.[15]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango was created in the autumn of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, began using Python to build applications. Jacob Kaplan-Moss was hired early in Django\u0027s development shortly before Simon Willison\u0027s internship ended.[16] It was released publicly under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist Django Reinhardt.[17] Adrian Holovaty is a Romani jazz guitar player inspired in part by Reinhardt\u0027s music.[18]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2008, it was announced that a newly formed Django Software Foundation (DSF) would maintain Django in the future.[19]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite having its own nomenclature, such as naming the callable objects generating the HTTP responses \"views\",[7] the core Django framework can be seen as an MVC architecture.[8] It consists of an object-relational mapper (ORM) that mediates between data models (defined as Python classes) and a relational database (\"Model\"), a system for processing HTTP requests with a web templating system (\"View\"), and a regular-expression-based URL dispatcher (\"Controller\").\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso included in the core framework are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main Django distribution also bundles a number of applications in its \"contrib\" package, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango\u0027s configuration system allows third party code to be plugged into a regular project, provided that it follows the reusable app[22] conventions. More than 5000 packages[23] are available to extend the framework\u0027s original behavior, providing solutions to issues the original tool didn\u0027t tackle: registration, search, API provision and consumption, CMS, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis extensibility is, however, mitigated by internal components\u0027 dependencies. While the Django philosophy implies loose coupling,[24] the template filters and tags assume one engine implementation, and both the auth and admin bundled applications require the use of the internal ORM. None of these filters or bundled apps are mandatory to run a Django project, but reusable apps tend to depend on them, encouraging developers to keep using the official stack in order to benefit fully from the apps ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango can be run in conjunction with Apache, Nginx using WSGI, Gunicorn, or Cherokee using flup (a Python module).[25][26] Django also includes the ability to launch a FastCGI server, enabling use behind any web server which supports FastCGI, such as Lighttpd or Hiawatha. It is also possible to use other WSGI-compliant web servers.[27] Django officially supports five database backends: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Oracle.[28] Microsoft SQL Server can be used with django-mssql while similarly external backends exist for IBM Db2,[29] SQL Anywhere[30] and Firebird.[31] There is a fork named django-nonrel, which supports NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB and Google App Engine\u0027s Datastore.[32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango may also be run in conjunction with Python on any Java EE application server such as GlassFish or JBoss. In this case django-jython must be installed in order to provide JDBC drivers for database connectivity, which also can provide functionality to compile Django in to a .war suitable for deployment.[33]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Django team will occasionally designate certain releases to be \"long-term support\" (LTS) releases.[34] LTS releases will get security and data loss fixes applied for a guaranteed period of time, typically 3+ years, regardless of the pace of releases afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a semiannual conference for Django developers and users, named \"DjangoCon\", that has been held since September 2008. DjangoCon is held annually in Europe, in May or June;[62] while another is held in the United States in August or September, in various cities.[63] The 2012 DjangoCon took place in Washington, D.C., from 3 to 8 September. 2013 DjangoCon was held in Chicago at the Hyatt Regency Hotel and the post-conference Sprints were hosted at Digital Bootcamp, computer training center.[64] The 2014 DjangoCon US returned to Portland, OR from 30 August to 6 September. The 2015 DjangoCon US was held in Austin, TX from 6 to 11 September at the AT\u0026T Executive Center. The 2016 DjangoCon US was held in Philadelphia, PA at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania from 17 to 22 July.[65] The 2017 DjangoCon US was held in Spokane, WA;[66] in 2018 DjangoCon US was held in San Diego, CA.[67] DjangoCon US 2019 was held again in San Diego, CA from Sept 22â27. DjangoCon 2021 took place virtually and in 2022, DjangoCon US returned to San Diego from October 16th to the 21st.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango mini-conferences are usually held every year as part of the Australian Python Conference \u0027PyCon AU\u0027.[68] Previously, these mini-conferences have been held in:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango has spawned user groups and meetups around the world, the most notable group is the Django Girls organization, which began in Poland but now has had events in 91 countries.[69][70][71]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgrammers have ported Django\u0027s template engine design from Python to other languages, providing decent cross-platform support.

Lets start with the basic file structure in AngularJS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, app.js is a JavaScript file in which I created an instance of an Angular module. The controller.js Javascript file has an Angular controller that is registered with the app.js Angular module and contains business logic (programming between end UI and database). index.html is the view page where I place my html code and loaded app.js and then controller.js script files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s implement app.js first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angular.module is a global place for creating, registering, and retrieving Angular modules. Modules are containers for the various parts of an application, such as controllers and directives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angular.module is the entry point of Angular applications. Each application has just one module that gets the rootElement \u003chtml\u003e or \u003cbody\u003e tag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe created an angular.module called myApp in app.js file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn controller.js, we register our Controller with the angular.module (i.e app) initialized in app.js\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eapp.controller has two parameters: the name of our controller and the required angular services/dependencies. For example, we loaded the $scope service and created an instance in the function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScope is a pre-defined object in Angular which uses $watch to watch the status of model. It\u0027s importnant to know that $scope has hierarchical structure, so scope inherits from its parent scope and is capable of creating child scopes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing $scope (and its built-in $watch command), we can bind html and js, causing changes in html to translate to changes in our js, and vice versa. In our example, we created a scope object called $scope.name and finished binding in view(html page).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen index.html is loaded, it injects angular.js, app.js, and controller.js into the browser per our defined script from index.html. As a result, angular.module is placed at rootElement, and myApp and MyCtrl become available for index.html.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngular has Directive components such as ngBind, ngValue, nclass and many more. In this article I explained just some of the ngApp and ngController directives. I will talk about other directives in my next tutorial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003engApp is Angular\u0027s pre-defined directive, meaning that Angular will default to ngApp if no other directive is present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf ngApp is not placed in rootElement, then the controller will fail to load. This failure arises because controller(myCtrl) is registered with ngApp(\"myApp\"), the unspecified default option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ngController directive binds the controller class to the view. This is a key aspect of how Angular supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModel â Models are data assingned to scope variable for the Document Object Model (DOM), and consumed by API $watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eView â The html template that rendered and bound to the value in DOM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eController â In this case, the ngController directive specifies a Controller class that contains business logic behind the application\u0027s functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{{name}} serves as a variable to store the $scope.name value present in the ngController myCtrl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eng-model provides a unique two-way-binding feature; it binds value to input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpressions are used to get or print the values of variables in the view. Direct directives appropriate the scope value for interpolation binding. However functionExpressions fail on this task. For Example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything written in input tag will be observed by scope API $watch and will display the value of the $scope.name object in paragraph tag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee plunker for live example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how we implement angular.module, register ngController to the Angular module, and use the scope variable with the controller and the view to bind with AngularJS\u0027s ngModel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope you found this article informative!

Unlike machine language, which consists of binary and hexadecimal characters, assembly languages are designed to be readable by humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLow-level programming languages such as assembly language are a necessary bridge between the underlying hardware of a computer and the higher-level programming languagesâsuch as Python or JavaScriptâin which modern software programs are written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFundamentally, the most basic instructions executed by a computer are binary codes, consisting of ones and zeros. Those codes are directly translated into the âonâ and âoffâ states of the electricity moving through the computerâs physical circuits. In essence, these simple codes form the basis of âmachine language,â the most fundamental variety of programming language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, no human can construct modern software programs by explicitly programming ones and zeros. Instead, human programmers must rely on various layers of abstraction that can allow themselves to articulate their commands in a format that is more intuitive to humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, modern programmers issue commands in so-called âhigh-level languages,â which utilize intuitive syntax such as whole English words and sentences, as well as logical operators such as âand,â âor,â and âelseâ that are familiar to everyday usage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, however, these high-level commands need to be translated into machine language. Rather than doing so manually, programmers rely on assembly languages whose purpose is to automatically translate between these high-level and low-level languages. The first assembly languages were developed in the 1940s, and though modern programmers and modern natural language processors spend very little time dealing with assembly languages, they nevertheless remain essential to the overall functioning of a computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the early days of computing, systems programming and application programming would both take place entirely in assembly language. Without assembly languages, many modern computers and higher-level languages we use today would not have been possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen writing any code in any program language, there is an observable, specific order of rules that must be followed to allow a compiler to execute the code without error. These rules are defined as the syntax, and they contain criteria such as the maximum number of allowable characters, what characters code lines must start with, or what certain symbols \"i.e. a semi-colon\" means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA label is a symbol that represents the address where an instruction or data is stored. It\u0027s purpose is to act as the destination when referenced in a statement. Labels can be used anywhere an address can be used in assembly languages. A symbolic label consists of an identifier followed by a colon, while numeric labels consist of a single digital followed by a colon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso referred to as commands, operators are logical expressions that occur after the label field. In addition, it must be preceded by at least one white-space character. Operators can either be opcode or directive. Opcode correspond directly to machine instructions, and the operation code includes any register name associated with the instruction. Alternatively, directive operation codes are instructions known by the assembler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectives are instructions to the assembler that tell what actions must take place during the assembly process. Directives have the importance of declaring or reserving memory for variables; these variables can be recalled later in processes to perform more dynamic functions. Directives are also used to break programs into different sections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn assembly language macro is a template shoe format presents a series or pattern of statements. This sequence of assembly language statements might be common to multiple different programs. A macro facility is used to interpret macro definitions, while a macro call is inserted into the source code where \"normal\" assembly code would have gone instead of the macro set of statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mnemonic is an abbreviation for an operation. A mnemonic is entered into the operation code for each assemble program instruction to specify a shortened \"opcode\" that represents a larger, complete set of codes. For example, the mnemonic \"multiply by two\" has a full set of code that carries out the mnemonic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, assembly languages remain the subject of study by computer science students, in order to help them understand how modern software relates to its underlying hardware platforms. In some cases, programmers must continue to write in assembly languages, such as when the demands on performance are especially high, or when the hardware in question is incompatible with any current high-level languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne such example that is relevant to finance are the high-frequency trading (HFT) platforms used by some financial firms. In this marketplace, the speed and accuracy of transactions is of paramount importance in order for the HFT trading strategies to prove profitable. Therefore, in order to gain an edge against their competitors, some HFT firms have written their trading software directly in assembly languages, thereby making it unnecessary to wait for the commands from a higher-level language to be translated into machine language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany believe assembly languages have the steepest learning curves and are the most difficult computing languages to learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly language can usually be executed faster than high level languages. It\u0027s relatively easy to insert of delete components of assembly language code, and assembly language usually requires fewer instructions to complete a task when compared against other types of languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly languages are also often used by programmers wanting greater control over their computers as assembly languages allow you to directly manipulate your hardware. Because of its speed and importance, some programs are specifically written using assembly language as the code can usually remain smaller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly languages do tend to have several drawbacks. Long programs written using assembly language usually require heavier computing power and can not be run on small computers. Some may find the syntax of assembly language more difficult to remember, and it may take some longer to code using assembly language as it is more complex. In addition, assembly language is usually not portable between different makes of different computers; similar to how employee benefits are lost when switching companies, languages cannot be seamlessly translated to different computers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExecution may be more simple compared to other languages\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExecution is usually faster compared to other languages\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllows for direct control over hardware\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCode may remain smaller compared to other languages\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgramming may be more challenging to pick up compared to high-level languages\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSyntax of assembly languages is difficult\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot portable between machines\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly language must be translated into machine language using an assembler. There are two primary types of assemblers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single-pass assembler scans a program one time and makes an equivalent binary program. This type of assembler validates assembly language code by looking the code up in a mnemonic code table. A single-pass assembler is often faster than a multi-pass assembler, and there is usually no need to construct any intermediate code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA multi-pass assembler means the assembler uses more than one pass. Multi-pass assemblers create a table with every symbol and each of their values in the first pass, then use the table in future passes to generate new code. Each separate pass usually handles a different specific task. Though usually slower, multi-pass assemblers with modular structures can often be reused for different machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow is an example of Netwide Assembler (NASM) assembly language code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoyola Marymount University\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this example, the SYSCALL instruction towards the end of the code triggers the portion of memory where the operating system services are stored. Then, the code RAX is used to call for code to be written, then RDI to exit. The SYSCALL function is used twice to invoke the operating system as well as to indicate to the system when the code is finished and it is time to exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most commonly used assembly languages include ARM, MIPS, and x86.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ is not comprised of assembly code. The C++ computing language consists of C++ code which a compiler translates into an executable machine code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython is more advanced than assembly languages. Assembly languages are considered a low level language, while high-level languages such as C, Java, or Python use 0\u0027s and 1\u0027s instead of numbers, symbols, and abbreviations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough considered lower level languages compared to more advanced languages, assembly languages are still used. Assembly language is used to directly manipulate hardware, access specialized processor instructions, or evaluate critical performance issues. These languages are also used to leverage their speed advantage over high level languages for time-sensitive activities such as high frequency trading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly language is low-level code that relies on a strong relationship between the instructions input using the coding language and how a machine interprets the code instructions. Code is converted into executable actions using an assembler that converts input into recognizable instructions for the machine. Though prevalent in the early days of computing, many larger systems use higher-level languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScienceDirect. \"Assembly Language.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Scott. \"Assembly Language.\" Introduction, 13.5.2 Hexadecimal and Octal Numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIEEE Computer Society. \"Coding From 1849 to 2022: a Guide to The Timeline of Programming Languages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonathan W.

OOP is the most popular programming paradigm used for software development and is taught as the standard way to code for most of a programmerâs educational career. Another popular programming paradigm is functional programming, but we wonât get into that right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday we will break down the basics of what makes a program object-oriented so that you can start to utilize this paradigm in your algorithms, projects, and interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, letâs dive into these OOP concepts and tutorials!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHereâs what will be covered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm in computer science that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages, including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOOP languages are not necessarily restricted to the object-oriented programming paradigm. Some languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP, all allow for both procedural and object-oriented programming styles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA class is an abstract blueprint that creates more specific, concrete objects. Classes often represent broad categories, like Car or Dog that share attributes. These classes define what attributes an instance of this type will have, like color, but not the value of those attributes for a specific object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClasses can also contain functions called methods that are available only to objects of that type. These functions are defined within the class and perform some action helpful to that specific object type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, our Car class may have a repaint method that changes the color attribute of our car. This function is only helpful to objects of type Car, so we declare it within the Car class, thus making it a method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClass templates are used as a blueprint to create individual objects. These represent specific examples of the abstract class, like myCar or goldenRetriever. Each object can have unique values to the properties defined in the class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, say we created a class, Car, to contain all the properties a car must have, color, brand, and model. We then create an instance of a Car type object, myCar to represent my specific car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could then set the value of the properties defined in the class to describe my car without affecting other objects or the class template.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can then reuse this class to represent any number of cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetâs take a real-world problem and conceptually design an OOP software program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine running a dog-sitting camp with hundreds of pets where you keep track of the names, ages, and days attended for each pet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow would you design simple, reusable software to model the dogs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith hundreds of dogs, it would be inefficient to write unique entries for each dog because you would be writing a lot of redundant code. Below we see what that might look like with objects rufus and fluffy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see above, there is a lot of duplicated code between both objects. The age() function appears in each object. Since we want the same information for each dog, we can use objects and classes instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrouping related information together to form a class structure makes the code shorter and easier to maintain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dogsitting example, hereâs how a programmer could think about organizing an OOP:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe diagram below represents how to design an OOP program by grouping the related data and behaviors together to form a simple template and then creating subgroups for specialized data and behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dog class is a generic template containing only the structure of data and behaviors common to all dogs as attributes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe then create two child classes of Dog, HerdingDog and TrackingDog. These have the inherited behaviors of Dog (bark()) but also behavior unique to dogs of that subtype.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, we create objects of the HerdingDog type to represent the individual dogs Fluffy and Maisel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can also create objects like Rufus that fit under the broad class of Dog but do not fit under either HerdingDog or TrackingDog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, weâll take a deeper look at each of the fundamental building blocks of an OOP program used above:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a nutshell, classes are essentially user-defined data types. Classes are where we create a blueprint for the structure of methods and attributes. Individual objects are instantiated from this blueprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClasses contain fields for attributes and methods for behaviors. In our Dog class example, attributes include name \u0026 birthday, while methods include bark() and updateAttendance().\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHereâs a code snippet demonstrating how to program a Dog class using the JavaScript language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember, the class is a template for modeling a dog, and an object is instantiated from the class representing an individual real-world item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoying the article? Scroll down to sign up for our free, bi-monthly newsletter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObjects are, unsurprisingly, a huge part of OOP! Objects are instances of a class created with specific data. For example, in the code snippet below, Rufus is an instance of the Dog class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the new class Dog is called:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgramming vocabulary:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn JavaScript, objects are a type of variable. This may cause confusion because objects can be declared without a class template in JavaScript, as shown at the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObjects have states and behaviors. The state of an object is defined by data: things like names, birthdates, and other information youâd want to store about a dog. Behaviors are methods the object can undertake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttributes are the information that is stored. Attributes are defined in the Class template. When objects are instantiated, individual objects contain data stored in the Attributes field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe state of an object is defined by the data in the objectâs attributes fields. For example, a puppy and a dog might be treated differently at a pet camp. The birthday could define the state of an object and allow the software to handle dogs of different ages differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMethods represent behaviors. Methods perform actions; methods might return information about an object or update an objectâs data. The methodâs code is defined in the class definition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen individual objects are instantiated, these objects can call the methods defined in the class. In the code snippet below, the bark method is defined in the Dog class, and the bark() method is called on the Rufus object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMethods often modify, update or delete data. Methods donât have to update data though. For example, the bark() method doesnât update any data because barking doesnât modify any of the attributes of the Dog class: name or birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe updateAttendance() method adds a day the Dog attended the pet-sitting camp. The attendance attribute is important to keep track of for billing Owners at the end of the month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMethods are how programmers promote reusability and keep functionality encapsulated inside an object. This reusability is a great benefit when debugging. If thereâs an error, thereâs only one place to find it and fix it instead of many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe underscore in _attendance denotes that the variable is protected and shouldnât be modified directly. The updateAttendance() method changes _attendance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four pillars of object-oriented programming are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInheritance allows classes to inherit features of other classes. Put another way, parent classes extend attributes and behaviors to child classes. Inheritance supports reusability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf basic attributes and behaviors are defined in a parent class, child classes can be created, extending the functionality of the parent class and adding additional attributes and behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, herding dogs have the unique ability to herd animals. In other words, all herding dogs are dogs, but not all dogs are herding dogs. We represent this difference by creating a child class HerdingDog from the parent class Dog, and then adding the unique herd() behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefits of inheritance are programs can create a generic parent class and then create more specific child classes as needed. This simplifies programming because instead of recreating the structure of the Dog class multiple times, child classes automatically gain access to functionalities within their parent class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the following code snippet, child class HerdingDog inherits the method bark from the parent class Dog, and the child class adds an additional method, herd().\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotice that the HerdingDog class does not have a copy of the bark() method. It inherits the bark() method defined in the parent Dog class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the code calls fluffy.bark() method, the bark() method walks up the chain of child to parent classes to find where the bark method is defined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Parent classes are also known as superclasses or base classes. The child class can also be called a subclass, derived class, or extended class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn JavaScript, inheritance is also known as prototyping. A prototype object is a template for another object to inherit properties and behaviors. There can be multiple prototype object templates, creating a prototype chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the same concept as the parent/child inheritance. Inheritance is from parent to child. In our example, all three dogs can bark, but only Maisel and Fluffy can herd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe herd() method is defined in the child HerdingDog class, so the two objects, Maisel and Fluffy, instantiated from the HerdingDog class have access to the herd() method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRufus is an object instantiated from the parent class Dog, so Rufus only has access to the bark() method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncapsulation means containing all important information inside an object, and only exposing selected information to the outside world. Attributes and behaviors are defined by code inside the class template.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, when an object is instantiated from the class, the data and methods are encapsulated in that object. Encapsulation hides the internal software code implementation inside a class and hides the internal data of inside objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncapsulation requires defining some fields as private and some as public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetâs use a car as a metaphor for encapsulation. The information the car shares with the outside world, using blinkers to indicate turns, are public interfaces. In contrast, the engine is hidden under the hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eItâs a private, internal interface. When youâre driving a car down the road, other drivers require information to make decisions, like whether youâre turning left or right. However, exposing internal, private data like the engine temperature would confuse other drivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncapsulation adds security. Attributes and methods can be set to private, so they canât be accessed outside the class. To get information about data in an object, public methods \u0026 properties are used to access or update data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis adds a layer of security where the developer chooses what data can be seen on an object by exposing that data through public methods in the class definition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin classes, most programming languages have public, protected, and private sections. The public section is the limited selection of methods accessible from the outside world or other classes within the program. Protected is only accessible to child classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrivate code can only be accessed from within that class. To go back to our dog/owner example, encapsulation is ideal so owners canât access private information about other peopleâs dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: JavaScript has private and protected properties and methods. Protected Fields are prefixed with a _; private fields are prefixed with a #. Protected fields are inherited. Private ones arenât.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider the getAge() method in our example code, the calculation details are hidden inside the Dog class. The rufus object uses the getAge() method to calculate Rufusâs age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncapsulating \u0026 updating data: Since methods can also update an objectâs data, the developer controls what values can be changed through public methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis allows us to hide important information that should not be changed from phishing and the more likely scenario of other developers mistakenly changing important data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncapsulation adds security to code and makes it easier to collaborate with external developers. When youâre programming to share information with an external company, you wouldnât want to expose the classesâ templates or private data because your company owns that intellectual property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, developers create public methods that allow other developers to call methods on an object. Ideally, these public methods come with documentation for external developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefits of encapsulation are summarized here:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbstraction is an extension of encapsulation that uses classes and objects, which contain data and code, to hide the internal details of a program from its users. This is done by creating a layer of abstraction between the user and the more complex source code, which helps protect sensitive information stored within the source code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbstraction\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbstraction can also be explained using cars. Think of how a driver operates a vehicle using only the carâs dashboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA driver uses the carâs steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedals to control the vehicle. The driver does not have to worry about how the engine works or what parts are used for each movement. This is an abstraction â only the important aspects necessary for a driver to use the car are visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, data abstraction allows developers to work with complex information without worrying about its inner workings. In this way, it helps to improve code quality and readability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbstraction also serves an important security role. By only displaying selected pieces of data and only allowing data to be accessed through classes and modified through methods, we protect the data from exposure. To continue with the car example, you wouldnât want an open gas tank while driving a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefits of abstraction are summarized below:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolymorphism means designing objects to share behaviors. Using inheritance, objects can override shared parent behaviors with specific child behaviors. Polymorphism allows the same method to execute different behaviors in two ways: method overriding and method overloading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuntime polymorphism uses method overriding. In method overriding, a child class can implement differently than its parent class. In our dog example, we may want to give TrackingDog a specific type of bark different than the generic dog class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMethod overriding could create a bark() method in the child class that overrides the bark() method in the parent Dog class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompile Time polymorphism uses method overloading. Methods or functions may have the same name but a different number of parameters passed into the method call. Different results may occur depending on the number of parameters passed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this code example, if no parameters are passed into the updateAttendance() method. One day is added to the count. If a parameter is passed in updateAttendance(4), then 4 is passed into the x parameter in updateAttendance(x), and 4 days are added to the count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefits of Polymorphism are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject-oriented programming requires thinking about the structure of the program and planning out an object-oriented design before you start coding. OOP in computer programming focuses on how to break up the requirements into simple, reusable classes that can be used to blueprint instances of objects. Overall, implementing OOP allows for better data structures and reusability, saving time in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf youâd like to take a deep dive into OOP, Educative has courses for OOP in:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC#\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese courses are text-based with in-browser coding environments, so you can learn even faster and more efficiently.

However, OOP also has some drawbacks such as increased complexity in design and understanding, and potential for memory overhead due to object instantiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do you need OOP?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject-oriented programming (OOP) offers numerous benefits compared to procedural programming: It is more efficient and simpler to implement. OOP delivers a well-defined structure for programs. It aids in keeping the code concise and nonrepetitive, in line with the âDonât Repeat Yourselfâ (DRY) principle. It, therefore, makes it easier to maintain, modify, and debug the code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs object-oriented programming dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject-oriented programming (OOP) is far from obsolete.

That\u0027s a mouthful. In simpler words, Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe industry standard today is to use Virtual Machines (VMs) to run software applications. VMs run applications inside a guest Operating System, which runs on virtual hardware powered by the serverâs host OS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVMs are great at providing full process isolation for applications: there are very few ways a problem in the host operating system can affect the software running in the guest operating system, and vice-versa. But this isolation comes at great cost â the computational overhead spent virtualizing hardware for a guest OS to use is substantial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers take a different approach: by leveraging the low-level mechanics of the host operating system, containers provide most of the isolation of virtual machines at a fraction of the computing power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently, regardless of whether the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud, or even a developerâs personal laptop. This gives developers the ability to create predictable environments that are isolated from the rest of the applications and can be run anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom an operations standpoint, apart from portability containers also give more granular control over resources giving your infrastructure improved efficiency which can result in better utilization of your compute resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle Trends for Docker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to these benefits, containers (\u0026 Docker) have seen widespread adoption. Companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix and Salesforce leverage containers to make large engineering teams more productive and to improve utilization of compute resources. In fact, Google credited containers for eliminating the need for an entire data center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis tutorial aims to be the one-stop shop for getting your hands dirty with Docker. Apart from demystifying the Docker landscape, it\u0027ll give you hands-on experience with building and deploying your own webapps on the Cloud. We\u0027ll be using Amazon Web Services to deploy a static website, and two dynamic webapps on EC2 using Elastic Beanstalk and Elastic Container Service. Even if you have no prior experience with deployments, this tutorial should be all you need to get started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis document contains a series of several sections, each of which explains a particular aspect of Docker. In each section, we will be typing commands (or writing code). All the code used in the tutorial is available in the Github repo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: This tutorial uses version 18.05.0-ce of Docker. If you find any part of the tutorial incompatible with a future version, please raise an issue. Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no specific skills needed for this tutorial beyond a basic comfort with the command line and using a text editor. This tutorial uses git clone to clone the repository locally. If you don\u0027t have Git installed on your system, either install it or remember to manually download the zip files from Github. Prior experience in developing web applications will be helpful but is not required. As we proceed further along the tutorial, we\u0027ll make use of a few cloud services. If you\u0027re interested in following along, please create an account on each of these websites:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting all the tooling setup on your computer can be a daunting task, but thankfully as Docker has become stable, getting Docker up and running on your favorite OS has become very easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil a few releases ago, running Docker on OSX and Windows was quite a hassle. Lately however, Docker has invested significantly into improving the on-boarding experience for its users on these OSes, thus running Docker now is a cakewalk. The getting started guide on Docker has detailed instructions for setting up Docker on Mac, Linux and Windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you are done installing Docker, test your Docker installation by running the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have everything setup, it\u0027s time to get our hands dirty. In this section, we are going to run a Busybox container on our system and get a taste of the docker run command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo get started, let\u0027s run the following in our terminal:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Depending on how you\u0027ve installed docker on your system, you might see a permission denied error after running the above command. If you\u0027re on a Mac, make sure the Docker engine is running. If you\u0027re on Linux, then prefix your docker commands with sudo. Alternatively, you can create a docker group to get rid of this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pull command fetches the busybox image from the Docker registry and saves it to our system. You can use the docker images command to see a list of all images on your system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat! Let\u0027s now run a Docker container based on this image. To do that we are going to use the almighty docker run command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, nothing happened! Is that a bug? Well, no. Behind the scenes, a lot of stuff happened. When you call run, the Docker client finds the image (busybox in this case), loads up the container and then runs a command in that container. When we run docker run busybox, we didn\u0027t provide a command, so the container booted up, ran an empty command and then exited. Well, yeah - kind of a bummer. Let\u0027s try something more exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice - finally we see some output. In this case, the Docker client dutifully ran the echo command in our busybox container and then exited it. If you\u0027ve noticed, all of that happened pretty quickly. Imagine booting up a virtual machine, running a command and then killing it. Now you know why they say containers are fast! Ok, now it\u0027s time to see the docker ps command. The docker ps command shows you all containers that are currently running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince no containers are running, we see a blank line. Let\u0027s try a more useful variant: docker ps -a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what we see above is a list of all containers that we ran. Do notice that the STATUS column shows that these containers exited a few minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re probably wondering if there is a way to run more than just one command in a container. Let\u0027s try that now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning the run command with the -it flags attaches us to an interactive tty in the container. Now we can run as many commands in the container as we want. Take some time to run your favorite commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanger Zone: If you\u0027re feeling particularly adventurous you can try rm -rf bin in the container. Make sure you run this command in the container and not in your laptop/desktop. Doing this will make any other commands like ls, uptime not work. Once everything stops working, you can exit the container (type exit and press Enter) and then start it up again with the docker run -it busybox sh command. Since Docker creates a new container every time, everything should start working again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat concludes a whirlwind tour of the mighty docker run command, which would most likely be the command you\u0027ll use most often. It makes sense to spend some time getting comfortable with it. To find out more about run, use docker run --help to see a list of all flags it supports. As we proceed further, we\u0027ll see a few more variants of docker run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we move ahead though, let\u0027s quickly talk about deleting containers. We saw above that we can still see remnants of the container even after we\u0027ve exited by running docker ps -a. Throughout this tutorial, you\u0027ll run docker run multiple times and leaving stray containers will eat up disk space. Hence, as a rule of thumb, I clean up containers once I\u0027m done with them. To do that, you can run the docker rm command. Just copy the container IDs from above and paste them alongside the command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn deletion, you should see the IDs echoed back to you. If you have a bunch of containers to delete in one go, copy-pasting IDs can be tedious. In that case, you can simply run -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis command deletes all containers that have a status of exited. In case you\u0027re wondering, the -q flag, only returns the numeric IDs and -f filters output based on conditions provided. One last thing that\u0027ll be useful is the --rm flag that can be passed to docker run which automatically deletes the container once it\u0027s exited from. For one off docker runs, --rm flag is very useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn later versions of Docker, the docker container prune command can be used to achieve the same effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, you can also delete images that you no longer need by running docker rmi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last section, we used a lot of Docker-specific jargon which might be confusing to some. So before we go further, let me clarify some terminology that is used frequently in the Docker ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat! So we have now looked at docker run, played with a Docker container and also got a hang of some terminology. Armed with all this knowledge, we are now ready to get to the real-stuff, i.e. deploying web applications with Docker!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s start by taking baby-steps. The first thing we\u0027re going to look at is how we can run a dead-simple static website. We\u0027re going to pull a Docker image from Docker Hub, run the container and see how easy it is to run a webserver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s begin. The image that we are going to use is a single-page website that I\u0027ve already created for the purpose of this demo and hosted on the registry - prakhar1989/static-site. We can download and run the image directly in one go using docker run. As noted above, the --rm flag automatically removes the container when it exits and the -it flag specifies an interactive terminal which makes it easier to kill the container with Ctrl+C (on windows).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the image doesn\u0027t exist locally, the client will first fetch the image from the registry and then run the image. If all goes well, you should see a Nginx is running... message in your terminal. Okay now that the server is running, how to see the website? What port is it running on? And more importantly, how do we access the container directly from our host machine? Hit Ctrl+C to stop the container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, in this case, the client is not exposing any ports so we need to re-run the docker run command to publish ports. While we\u0027re at it, we should also find a way so that our terminal is not attached to the running container. This way, you can happily close your terminal and keep the container running. This is called detached mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the above command, -d will detach our terminal, -P will publish all exposed ports to random ports and finally --name corresponds to a name we want to give. Now we can see the ports by running the docker port [CONTAINER] command\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can open http://localhost:32769 in your browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: If you\u0027re using docker-toolbox, then you might need to use docker-machine ip default to get the IP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also specify a custom port to which the client will forward connections to the container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo stop a detached container, run docker stop by giving the container ID. In this case, we can use the name static-site we used to start the container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sure you agree that was super simple. To deploy this on a real server you would just need to install Docker, and run the above Docker command. Now that you\u0027ve seen how to run a webserver inside a Docker image, you must be wondering - how do I create my own Docker image? This is the question we\u0027ll be exploring in the next section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve looked at images before, but in this section we\u0027ll dive deeper into what Docker images are and build our own image! Lastly, we\u0027ll also use that image to run our application locally and finally deploy on AWS to share it with our friends! Excited? Great! Let\u0027s get started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocker images are the basis of containers. In the previous example, we pulled the Busybox image from the registry and asked the Docker client to run a container based on that image. To see the list of images that are available locally, use the docker images command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe above gives a list of images that I\u0027ve pulled from the registry, along with ones that I\u0027ve created myself (we\u0027ll shortly see how). The TAG refers to a particular snapshot of the image and the IMAGE ID is the corresponding unique identifier for that image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor simplicity, you can think of an image akin to a git repository - images can be committed with changes and have multiple versions. If you don\u0027t provide a specific version number, the client defaults to latest. For example, you can pull a specific version of ubuntu image\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo get a new Docker image you can either get it from a registry (such as the Docker Hub) or create your own. There are tens of thousands of images available on Docker Hub. You can also search for images directly from the command line using docker search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn important distinction to be aware of when it comes to images is the difference between base and child images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBase images are images that have no parent image, usually images with an OS like ubuntu, busybox or debian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChild images are images that build on base images and add additional functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there are official and user images, which can be both base and child images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficial images are images that are officially maintained and supported by the folks at Docker. These are typically one word long. In the list of images above, the python, ubuntu, busybox and hello-world images are official images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUser images are images created and shared by users like you and me. They build on base images and add additional functionality. Typically, these are formatted as user/image-name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have a better understanding of images, it\u0027s time to create our own. Our goal in this section will be to create an image that sandboxes a simple Flask application. For the purposes of this workshop, I\u0027ve already created a fun little Flask app that displays a random cat .gif every time it is loaded - because you know, who doesn\u0027t like cats? If you haven\u0027t already, please go ahead and clone the repository locally like so -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis should be cloned on the machine where you are running the docker commands and not inside a docker container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next step now is to create an image with this web app. As mentioned above, all user images are based on a base image. Since our application is written in Python, the base image we\u0027re going to use will be Python 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains a list of commands that the Docker client calls while creating an image. It\u0027s a simple way to automate the image creation process. The best part is that the commands you write in a Dockerfile are almost identical to their equivalent Linux commands. This means you don\u0027t really have to learn new syntax to create your own dockerfiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe application directory does contain a Dockerfile but since we\u0027re doing this for the first time, we\u0027ll create one from scratch. To start, create a new blank file in our favorite text-editor and save it in the same folder as the flask app by the name of Dockerfile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe start with specifying our base image. Use the FROM keyword to do that -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next step usually is to write the commands of copying the files and installing the dependencies. First, we set a working directory and then copy all the files for our app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, that we have the files, we can install the dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing we need to specify is the port number that needs to be exposed. Since our flask app is running on port 5000, that\u0027s what we\u0027ll indicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last step is to write the command for running the application, which is simply - python ./app.py. We use the CMD command to do that -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary purpose of CMD is to tell the container which command it should run when it is started. With that, our Dockerfile is now ready. This is how it looks -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have our Dockerfile, we can build our image. The docker build command does the heavy-lifting of creating a Docker image from a Dockerfile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe section below shows you the output of running the same. Before you run the command yourself (don\u0027t forget the period), make sure to replace my username with yours. This username should be the same one you created when you registered on Docker hub. If you haven\u0027t done that yet, please go ahead and create an account. The docker build command is quite simple - it takes an optional tag name with -t and a location of the directory containing the Dockerfile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don\u0027t have the python:3.8 image, the client will first pull the image and then create your image. Hence, your output from running the command will look different from mine. If everything went well, your image should be ready! Run docker images and see if your image shows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last step in this section is to run the image and see if it actually works (replacing my username with yours).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe command we just ran used port 5000 for the server inside the container and exposed this externally on port 8888. Head over to the URL with port 8888, where your app should be live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCongratulations! You have successfully created your first docker image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat good is an application that can\u0027t be shared with friends, right? So in this section we are going to see how we can deploy our awesome application to the cloud so that we can share it with our friends! We\u0027re going to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to get our application up and running in a few clicks. We\u0027ll also see how easy it is to make our application scalable and manageable with Beanstalk!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing that we need to do before we deploy our app to AWS is to publish our image on a registry which can be accessed by AWS. There are many different Docker registries you can use (you can even host your own). For now, let\u0027s use Docker Hub to publish the image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this is the first time you are pushing an image, the client will ask you to login. Provide the same credentials that you used for logging into Docker Hub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo publish, just type the below command remembering to replace the name of the image tag above with yours. It is important to have the format of yourusername/image_name so that the client knows where to publish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce that is done, you can view your image on Docker Hub. For example, here\u0027s the web page for my image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: One thing that I\u0027d like to clarify before we go ahead is that it is not imperative to host your image on a public registry (or any registry) in order to deploy to AWS. In case you\u0027re writing code for the next million-dollar unicorn startup you can totally skip this step. The reason why we\u0027re pushing our images publicly is that it makes deployment super simple by skipping a few intermediate configuration steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that your image is online, anyone who has docker installed can play with your app by typing just a single command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027ve pulled your hair out in setting up local dev environments / sharing application configuration in the past, you very well know how awesome this sounds. That\u0027s why Docker is so cool!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB) is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) offered by AWS. If you\u0027ve used Heroku, Google App Engine etc. you\u0027ll feel right at home. As a developer, you just tell EB how to run your app and it takes care of the rest - including scaling, monitoring and even updates. In April 2014, EB added support for running single-container Docker deployments which is what we\u0027ll use to deploy our app. Although EB has a very intuitive CLI, it does require some setup, and to keep things simple we\u0027ll use the web UI to launch our application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo follow along, you need a functioning AWS account. If you haven\u0027t already, please go ahead and do that now - you will need to enter your credit card information. But don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s free and anything we do in this tutorial will also be free! Let\u0027s get started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are the steps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we wait, let\u0027s quickly see what the Dockerrun.aws.json file contains. This file is basically an AWS specific file that tells EB details about our application and docker configuration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe file should be pretty self-explanatory, but you can always reference the official documentation for more information. We provide the name of the image that EB should use along with a port that the container should open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully by now, our instance should be ready. Head over to the EB page and you should see a green tick indicating that your app is alive and kicking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo ahead and open the URL in your browser and you should see the application in all its glory. Feel free to email / IM / snapchat this link to your friends and family so that they can enjoy a few cat gifs, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you done basking in the glory of your app, remember to terminate the environment so that you don\u0027t end up getting charged for extra resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCongratulations! You have deployed your first Docker application! That might seem like a lot of steps, but with the command-line tool for EB you can almost mimic the functionality of Heroku in a few keystrokes! Hopefully, you agree that Docker takes away a lot of the pains of building and deploying applications in the cloud. I would encourage you to read the AWS documentation on single-container Docker environments to get an idea of what features exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next (and final) part of the tutorial, we\u0027ll up the ante a bit and deploy an application that mimics the real-world more closely; an app with a persistent back-end storage tier. Let\u0027s get straight to it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last section, we saw how easy and fun it is to run applications with Docker. We started with a simple static website and then tried a Flask app. Both of which we could run locally and in the cloud with just a few commands. One thing both these apps had in common was that they were running in a single container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose of you who have experience running services in production know that usually apps nowadays are not that simple. There\u0027s almost always a database (or any other kind of persistent storage) involved. Systems such as Redis and Memcached have become de rigueur of most web application architectures. Hence, in this section we are going to spend some time learning how to Dockerize applications which rely on different services to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn particular, we are going to see how we can run and manage multi-container docker environments. Why multi-container you might ask? Well, one of the key points of Docker is the way it provides isolation. The idea of bundling a process with its dependencies in a sandbox (called containers) is what makes this so powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like it\u0027s a good strategy to decouple your application tiers, it is wise to keep containers for each of the services separate. Each tier is likely to have different resource needs and those needs might grow at different rates. By separating the tiers into different containers, we can compose each tier using the most appropriate instance type based on different resource needs. This also plays in very well with the whole microservices movement which is one of the main reasons why Docker (or any other container technology) is at the forefront of modern microservices architectures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app that we\u0027re going to Dockerize is called SF Food Trucks. My goal in building this app was to have something that is useful (in that it resembles a real-world application), relies on at least one service, but is not too complex for the purpose of this tutorial. This is what I came up with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app\u0027s backend is written in Python (Flask) and for search it uses Elasticsearch. Like everything else in this tutorial, the entire source is available on Github. We\u0027ll use this as our candidate application for learning out how to build, run and deploy a multi-container environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst up, let\u0027s clone the repository locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flask-app folder contains the Python application, while the utils folder has some utilities to load the data into Elasticsearch. The directory also contains some YAML files and a Dockerfile, all of which we\u0027ll see in greater detail as we progress through this tutorial. If you are curious, feel free to take a look at the files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you\u0027re excited (hopefully), let\u0027s think of how we can Dockerize the app. We can see that the application consists of a Flask backend server and an Elasticsearch service. A natural way to split this app would be to have two containers - one running the Flask process and another running the Elasticsearch (ES) process. That way if our app becomes popular, we can scale it by adding more containers depending on where the bottleneck lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat, so we need two containers. That shouldn\u0027t be hard right? We\u0027ve already built our own Flask container in the previous section. And for Elasticsearch, let\u0027s see if we can find something on the hub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite unsurprisingly, there exists an officially supported image for Elasticsearch. To get ES running, we can simply use docker run and have a single-node ES container running locally within no time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Elastic, the company behind Elasticsearch, maintains its own registry for Elastic products. It\u0027s recommended to use the images from that registry if you plan to use Elasticsearch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s first pull the image\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then run it in development mode by specifying ports and setting an environment variable that configures the Elasticsearch cluster to run as a single-node.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: If your container runs into memory issues, you might need to tweak some JVM flags to limit its memory consumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs seen above, we use --name es to give our container a name which makes it easy to use in subsequent commands. Once the container is started, we can see the logs by running docker container logs with the container name (or ID) to inspect the logs. You should see logs similar to below if Elasticsearch started successfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Elasticsearch takes a few seconds to start so you might need to wait before you see initialized in the logs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, lets try to see if can send a request to the Elasticsearch container. We use the 9200 port to send a cURL request to the container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet! It\u0027s looking good! While we are at it, let\u0027s get our Flask container running too. But before we get to that, we need a Dockerfile. In the last section, we used python:3.8 image as our base image. This time, however, apart from installing Python dependencies via pip, we want our application to also generate our minified Javascript file for production. For this, we\u0027ll require Nodejs. Since we need a custom build step, we\u0027ll start from the ubuntu base image to build our Dockerfile from scratch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: if you find that an existing image doesn\u0027t cater to your needs, feel free to start from another base image and tweak it yourself. For most of the images on Docker Hub, you should be able to find the corresponding Dockerfile on Github. Reading through existing Dockerfiles is one of the best ways to learn how to roll your own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur Dockerfile for the flask app looks like below -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite a few new things here so let\u0027s quickly go over this file. We start off with the Ubuntu LTS base image and use the package manager apt-get to install the dependencies namely - Python and Node. The yqq flag is used to suppress output and assumes \"Yes\" to all prompts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe then use the ADD command to copy our application into a new volume in the container - /opt/flask-app. This is where our code will reside. We also set this as our working directory, so that the following commands will be run in the context of this location. Now that our system-wide dependencies are installed, we get around to installing app-specific ones. First off we tackle Node by installing the packages from npm and running the build command as defined in our package.json file. We finish the file off by installing the Python packages, exposing the port and defining the CMD to run as we did in the last section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, we can go ahead, build the image and run the container (replace yourusername with your username below).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first run, this will take some time as the Docker client will download the ubuntu image, run all the commands and prepare your image. Re-running docker build after any subsequent changes you make to the application code will almost be instantaneous. Now let\u0027s try running our app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOops! Our flask app was unable to run since it was unable to connect to Elasticsearch. How do we tell one container about the other container and get them to talk to each other? The answer lies in the next section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we talk about the features Docker provides especially to deal with such scenarios, let\u0027s see if we can figure out a way to get around the problem. Hopefully, this should give you an appreciation for the specific feature that we are going to study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so let\u0027s run docker container ls (which is same as docker ps) and see what we have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we have one ES container running on 0.0.0.0:9200 port which we can directly access. If we can tell our Flask app to connect to this URL, it should be able to connect and talk to ES, right? Let\u0027s dig into our Python code and see how the connection details are defined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make this work, we need to tell the Flask container that the ES container is running on 0.0.0.0 host (the port by default is 9200) and that should make it work, right? Unfortunately, that is not correct since the IP 0.0.0.0 is the IP to access ES container from the host machine i.e. from my Mac. Another container will not be able to access this on the same IP address. Okay if not that IP, then which IP address should the ES container be accessible by? I\u0027m glad you asked this question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow is a good time to start our exploration of networking in Docker. When docker is installed, it creates three networks automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge network is the network in which containers are run by default. So that means that when I ran the ES container, it was running in this bridge network. To validate this, let\u0027s inspect the network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can see that our container 277451c15ec1 is listed under the Containers section in the output. What we also see is the IP address this container has been allotted - 172.17.0.2. Is this the IP address that we\u0027re looking for? Let\u0027s find out by running our flask container and trying to access this IP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis should be fairly straightforward to you by now. We start the container in the interactive mode with the bash process. The --rm is a convenient flag for running one off commands since the container gets cleaned up when its work is done. We try a curl but we need to install it first. Once we do that, we see that we can indeed talk to ES on 172.17.0.2:9200. Awesome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough we have figured out a way to make the containers talk to each other, there are still two problems with this approach -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do we tell the Flask container that es hostname stands for 172.17.0.2 or some other IP since the IP can change?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the bridge network is shared by every container by default, this method is not secure. How do we isolate our network?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good news that Docker has a great answer to our questions. It allows us to define our own networks while keeping them isolated using the docker network command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s first go ahead and create our own network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe network create command creates a new bridge network, which is what we need at the moment. In terms of Docker, a bridge network uses a software bridge which allows containers connected to the same bridge network to communicate, while providing isolation from containers which are not connected to that bridge network. The Docker bridge driver automatically installs rules in the host machine so that containers on different bridge networks cannot communicate directly with each other. There are other kinds of networks that you can create, and you are encouraged to read about them in the official docs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have a network, we can launch our containers inside this network using the --net flag. Let\u0027s do that - but first, in order to launch a new container with the same name, we will stop and remove our ES container that is running in the bridge (default) network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, our es container is now running inside the foodtrucks-net bridge network. Now let\u0027s inspect what happens when we launch in our foodtrucks-net network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWohoo! That works! On user-defined networks like foodtrucks-net, containers can not only communicate by IP address, but can also resolve a container name to an IP address. This capability is called automatic service discovery. Great! Let\u0027s launch our Flask container for real now -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHead over to http://0.0.0.0:5000 and see your glorious app live! Although that might have seemed like a lot of work, we actually just typed 4 commands to go from zero to running. I\u0027ve collated the commands in a bash script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow imagine you are distributing your app to a friend, or running on a server that has docker installed. You can get a whole app running with just one command!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s it! If you ask me, I find this to be an extremely awesome, and a powerful way of sharing and running your applications!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTill now we\u0027ve spent all our time exploring the Docker client. In the Docker ecosystem, however, there are a bunch of other open-source tools which play very nicely with Docker. A few of them are -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this section, we are going to look at one of these tools, Docker Compose, and see how it can make dealing with multi-container apps easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe background story of Docker Compose is quite interesting. Roughly around January 2014, a company called OrchardUp launched a tool called Fig. The idea behind Fig was to make isolated development environments work with Docker. The project was very well received on Hacker News - I oddly remember reading about it but didn\u0027t quite get the hang of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first comment on the forum actually does a good job of explaining what Fig is all about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo really at this point, that\u0027s what Docker is about: running processes. Now Docker offers a quite rich API to run the processes: shared volumes (directories) between containers (i.e. running images), forward port from the host to the container, display logs, and so on. But that\u0027s it: Docker as of now, remains at the process level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it provides options to orchestrate multiple containers to create a single \"app\", it doesn\u0027t address the management of such group of containers as a single entity. And that\u0027s where tools such as Fig come in: talking about a group of containers as a single entity. Think \"run an app\" (i.e. \"run an orchestrated cluster of containers\") instead of \"run a container\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turns out that a lot of people using docker agree with this sentiment. Slowly and steadily as Fig became popular, Docker Inc. took notice, acquired the company and re-branded Fig as Docker Compose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what is Compose used for? Compose is a tool that is used for defining and running multi-container Docker apps in an easy way. It provides a configuration file called docker-compose.yml that can be used to bring up an application and the suite of services it depends on with just one command. Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows, although Compose is ideal for development and testing environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s see if we can create a docker-compose.yml file for our SF-Foodtrucks app and evaluate whether Docker Compose lives up to its promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step, however, is to install Docker Compose. If you\u0027re running Windows or Mac, Docker Compose is already installed as it comes in the Docker Toolbox. Linux users can easily get their hands on Docker Compose by following the instructions on the docs. Since Compose is written in Python, you can also simply do pip install docker-compose. Test your installation with -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have it installed, we can jump on the next step i.e. the Docker Compose file docker-compose.yml. The syntax for YAML is quite simple and the repo already contains the docker-compose file that we\u0027ll be using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me breakdown what the file above means. At the parent level, we define the names of our services - es and web. The image parameter is always required, and for each service that we want Docker to run, we can add additional parameters. For es, we just refer to the elasticsearch image available on Elastic registry. For our Flask app, we refer to the image that we built at the beginning of this section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther parameters such as command and ports provide more information about the container. The volumes parameter specifies a mount point in our web container where the code will reside. This is purely optional and is useful if you need access to logs, etc. We\u0027ll later see how this can be useful during development. Refer to the online reference to learn more about the parameters this file supports. We also add volumes for the es container so that the data we load persists between restarts. We also specify depends_on, which tells docker to start the es container before web. You can read more about it on docker compose docs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: You must be inside the directory with the docker-compose.yml file in order to execute most Compose commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat! Now the file is ready, let\u0027s see docker-compose in action. But before we start, we need to make sure the ports and names are free. So if you have the Flask and ES containers running, lets turn them off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we can run docker-compose. Navigate to the food trucks directory and run docker-compose up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHead over to the IP to see your app live. That was amazing wasn\u0027t it? Just a few lines of configuration and we have two Docker containers running successfully in unison. Let\u0027s stop the services and re-run in detached mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsurprisingly, we can see both the containers running successfully. Where do the names come from? Those were created automatically by Compose. But does Compose also create the network automatically? Good question! Let\u0027s find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, let us stop the services from running. We can always bring them back up in just one command. Data volumes will persist, so itâs possible to start the cluster again with the same data using docker-compose up. To destroy the cluster and the data volumes, just type docker-compose down -v.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we\u0027re are at it, we\u0027ll also remove the foodtrucks network that we created last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat! Now that we have a clean slate, let\u0027s re-run our services and see if Compose does its magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, so good. Time to see if any networks were created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can see that compose went ahead and created a new network called foodtrucks_default and attached both the new services in that network so that each of these are discoverable to the other. Each container for a service joins the default network and is both reachable by other containers on that network, and discoverable by them at a hostname identical to the container name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we jump to the next section, there\u0027s one last thing I wanted to cover about docker-compose. As stated earlier, docker-compose is really great for development and testing. So let\u0027s see how we can configure compose to make our lives easier during development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout this tutorial, we\u0027ve worked with readymade docker images. While we\u0027ve built images from scratch, we haven\u0027t touched any application code yet and mostly restricted ourselves to editing Dockerfiles and YAML configurations. One thing that you must be wondering is how does the workflow look during development? Is one supposed to keep creating Docker images for every change, then publish it and then run it to see if the changes work as expected? I\u0027m sure that sounds super tedious. There has to be a better way. In this section, that\u0027s what we\u0027re going to explore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s see how we can make a change in the Foodtrucks app we just ran. Make sure you have the app running,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let\u0027s see if we can change this app to display a Hello world! message when a request is made to /hello route. Currently, the app responds with a 404.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy does this happen? Since ours is a Flask app, we can see app.py (link) for answers. In Flask, routes are defined with @app.route syntax. In the file, you\u0027ll see that we only have three routes defined - /,/debugand/search. The/route renders the main app, thedebugroute is used to return some debug information and finallysearch is used by the app to query elasticsearch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that context, how would we add a new route for hello? You guessed it! Let\u0027s open flask-app/app.py in our favorite editor and make the following change\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let\u0027s try making a request again\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no! That didn\u0027t work! What did we do wrong? While we did make the change in app.py, the file resides in our machine (or the host machine), but since Docker is running our containers based off the yourusername/foodtrucks-web image, it doesn\u0027t know about this change. To validate this, lets try the following -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we\u0027re trying to do here is to validate that our changes are not in the app.py that\u0027s running in the container. We do this by running the command docker-compose run, which is similar to its cousin docker run but takes additional arguments for the service (which is web in our case). As soon as we run bash, the shell opens in /opt/flask-app as specified in our Dockerfile. From the grep command we can see that our changes are not in the file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLets see how we can fix it. First off, we need to tell docker compose to not use the image and instead use the files locally. We\u0027ll also set debug mode to true so that Flask knows to reload the server when app.py changes. Replace the web portion of the docker-compose.yml file like so:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that change (diff), let\u0027s stop and start the containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a final step, lets make the change in app.py by adding a new route. Now we try to curl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWohoo! We get a valid response! Try playing around by making more changes in the app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat concludes our tour of Docker Compose. With Docker Compose, you can also pause your services, run a one-off command on a container and even scale the number of containers. I also recommend you checkout a few other use-cases of Docker compose. Hopefully, I was able to show you how easy it is to manage multi-container environments with Compose. In the final section, we are going to deploy our app to AWS!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last section we used docker-compose to run our app locally with a single command: docker-compose up. Now that we have a functioning app we want to share this with the world, get some users, make tons of money and buy a big house in Miami. Executing the last three are beyond the scope of the tutorial, so we\u0027ll spend our time instead on figuring out how we can deploy our multi-container apps on the cloud with AWS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far you are pretty much convinced that Docker is a pretty cool technology. And you are not alone. Seeing the meteoric rise of Docker, almost all Cloud vendors started working on adding support for deploying Docker apps on their platform. As of today, you can deploy containers on Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Azure and many others. We already got a primer on deploying single container apps with Elastic Beanstalk and in this section we are going to look at Elastic Container Service (or ECS) by AWS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAWS ECS is a scalable and super flexible container management service that supports Docker containers. It allows you to operate a Docker cluster on top of EC2 instances via an easy-to-use API. Where Beanstalk came with reasonable defaults, ECS allows you to completely tune your environment as per your needs. This makes ECS, in my opinion, quite complex to get started with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily for us, ECS has a friendly CLI tool that understands Docker Compose files and automatically provisions the cluster on ECS! Since we already have a functioning docker-compose.yml it should not take a lot of effort in getting up and running on AWS. So let\u0027s get started!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step is to install the CLI. Instructions to install the CLI on both Mac and Linux are explained very clearly in the official docs. Go ahead, install the CLI and when you are done, verify the install by running\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, we\u0027ll be working on configuring the CLI so that we can talk to ECS. We\u0027ll be following the steps as detailed in the official guide on AWS ECS docs. In case of any confusion, please feel free to refer to that guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step will involve creating a profile that we\u0027ll use for the rest of the tutorial. To continue, you\u0027ll need your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. To obtain these, follow the steps as detailed under the section titled Access Key and Secret Access Key on this page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, we need to get a keypair which we\u0027ll be using to log into the instances. Head over to your EC2 Console and create a new keypair. Download the keypair and store it in a safe location. Another thing to note before you move away from this screen is the region name. In my case, I have named my key - ecs and set my region as us-east-1. This is what I\u0027ll assume for the rest of this walkthrough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next step is to configure the CLI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe provide the configure command with the region name we want our cluster to reside in and a cluster name. Make sure you provide the same region name that you used when creating the keypair. If you\u0027ve not configured the AWS CLI on your computer before, you can use the official guide, which explains everything in great detail on how to get everything going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next step enables the CLI to create a CloudFormation template.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we provide the name of the keypair we downloaded initially (ecs in my case), the number of instances that we want to use (--size) and the type of instances that we want the containers to run on. The --capability-iam flag tells the CLI that we acknowledge that this command may create IAM resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last and final step is where we\u0027ll use our docker-compose.yml file. We\u0027ll need to make a few minor changes, so instead of modifying the original, let\u0027s make a copy of it. The contents of this file (after making the changes) look like (below) -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only changes we made from the original docker-compose.yml are of providing the mem_limit (in bytes) and cpu_shares values for each container and adding some logging configuration. This allows us to view logs generated by our containers in AWS CloudWatch. Head over to CloudWatch to create a log group called foodtrucks. Note that since ElasticSearch typically ends up taking more memory, we\u0027ve given around 3.4 GB of memory limit. Another thing we need to do before we move onto the next step is to publish our image on Docker Hub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat! Now let\u0027s run the final command that will deploy our app on ECS!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not a coincidence that the invocation above looks similar to the one we used with Docker Compose. If everything went well, you should see a desiredStatus\u003dRUNNING lastStatus\u003dRUNNING as the last line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwesome! Our app is live, but how can we access it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo ahead and open http://54.86.14.14 in your browser and you should see the Food Trucks in all its black-yellow glory! Since we\u0027re on the topic, let\u0027s see how our AWS ECS console looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can see above that our ECS cluster called \u0027foodtrucks\u0027 was created and is now running 1 task with 2 container instances. Spend some time browsing this console to get a hang of all the options that are here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you\u0027ve played around with the deployed app, remember to turn down the cluster -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there you have it. With just a few commands we were able to deploy our awesome app on the AWS cloud!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s a wrap! After a long, exhaustive but fun tutorial you are now ready to take the container world by storm! If you followed along till the very end then you should definitely be proud of yourself. You learned how to setup Docker, run your own containers, play with static and dynamic websites and most importantly got hands on experience with deploying your applications to the cloud!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope that finishing this tutorial makes you more confident in your abilities to deal with servers. When you have an idea of building your next app, you can be sure that you\u0027ll be able to get it in front of people with minimal effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour journey into the container world has just started! My goal with this tutorial was to whet your appetite and show you the power of Docker. In the sea of new technology, it can be hard to navigate the waters alone and tutorials such as this one can provide a helping hand. This is the Docker tutorial I wish I had when I was starting out. Hopefully, it served its purpose of getting you excited about containers so that you no longer have to watch the action from the sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow are a few additional resources that will be beneficial. For your next project, I strongly encourage you to use Docker. Keep in mind - practice makes perfect!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditional Resources\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff you go, young padawan!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the tutorial is over, it\u0027s my turn to ask questions. How did you like the tutorial? Did you find the tutorial to be a complete mess or did you have fun and learn something?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSend in your thoughts directly to me or just create an issue. I\u0027m on Twitter, too, so if that\u0027s your deal, feel free to holler there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would totally love to hear about your experience with this tutorial. Give suggestions on how to make this better or let me know about my mistakes.

However, the roughly 97% of survey respondents who haven\u0027t used Rust may wonder, \"What\u0027s the deal with Rust?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe short answer is that Rust solves pain points present in many other languages, providing a solid step forward with a limited number of downsides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIâll show a sample of what Rust offers to users of other programming languages and what the current ecosystem looks like. Itâs not all roses in Rust-land, so I talk about the downsides, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arguments between programmers who prefer dynamic versus static type systems are likely to endure for decades more, but it\u0027s hard to argue about the benefits of static types. You only need to look at the rise of languages like TypeScript or features like Python\u0027s type hints as people have become frustrated with the current state of dynamic typing in today\u0027s larger codebases. Statically-typed languages allow for compiler-checked constraints on the data and its behavior, alleviating cognitive overhead and misunderstandings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0027t to say that all static type systems are equivalent. Many statically-typed languages have a large asterisk next to them: they allow for the concept of NULL. This means any value may be what it says or nothing, effectively creating a second possible type for every type. Like Haskell and some other modern programming languages, Rust encodes this possibility using an optional type, and the compiler requires you to handle the None case. This prevents occurrences of the dreaded TypeError: Cannot read property \u0027foo\u0027 of null runtime error (or language equivalent), instead promoting it to a compile time error you can resolve before a user ever sees it. Here\u0027s an example of a function to greet someone whether or not we know their name; if we had forgotten the None case in the match or tried to use name as if it was an always-present String value, the compiler would complain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust\u0027s static typing does its best to get out of the programmer\u0027s way while encouraging long-term maintainability. Some statically-typed languages place a large burden on the programmer, requiring them to repeat the type of a variable multiple times, which hinders readability and refactoring. Other statically-typed languages allow whole-program type inference. While convenient during initial development, this reduces the ability of the compiler to provide useful error information when types no longer match. Rust learns from both of these styles and requires top-level items like function arguments and constants to have explicit types, while allowing type inference inside of function bodies. In this example, the Rust compiler can infer the type of twice, 2, and 1 because the val parameter and the return type are declared as 32-bit signed integers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest benefits of using a systems programming language is the ability to have control over low-level details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust gives you the choice of storing data on the stack or on the heap and determines at compile time when memory is no longer needed and can be cleaned up. This allows efficient usage of memory as well as more performant memory access. Tilde, an early production user of Rust in their Skylight product, found they were able to reduce their memory usage from 5GiB to 50MiB by rewriting certain Java HTTP endpoints in idiomatic Rust. Savings like this quickly add up when cloud providers charge premium prices for increased memory or additional nodes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout the need to have a garbage collector continuously running, Rust projects are well-suited to be used as libraries by other programming languages via foreign-function interfaces. This allows existing projects to replace performance-critical pieces with speedy Rust code without the memory safety risks inherent with other systems programming languages. Some projects have even been incrementally rewritten in Rust using these techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith direct access to hardware and memory, Rust is an ideal language for embedded and bare-metal development. You can write extremely low-level code, such as operating system kernels or microcontroller applications. Rust\u0027s core types and functions as well as reusable library code shine in these especially challenging environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo many people, Rust is largely viewed as an alternative to other systems programming languages, like C or C++. The biggest benefit Rust can provide compared to these languages is the borrow checker. This is the part of the compiler responsible for ensuring that references do not outlive the data they refer to, and it helps eliminate entire classes of bugs caused by memory unsafety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike many existing systems programming languages, Rust doesn\u0027t require that you spend all of your time mired in nitty-gritty details. Rust strives to have as many zero-cost abstractions as possibleâabstractions that are as equally as performant as the equivalent hand-written code. In this example, we show how iterators, a primary Rust abstraction, can be used to succinctly create a vector containing the first ten square numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen safe Rust isn\u0027t able to express some concept, you can use unsafe Rust. This unlocks a few extra powers, but in exchange the programmer is now responsible for ensuring that the code is truly safe. This unsafe code can then be wrapped in higher-level abstractions which guarantee that all uses of the abstraction are safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing unsafe code should be a calculated decision, as using it correctly requires as much thought and care as any other language where you are responsible for avoiding undefined behavior. Minimizing unsafe code is the best way to minimize the possibilities for segfaults and vulnerabilities due to memory unsafety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSystems programming languages have the implicit expectation that they will be around effectively forever. While some modern development doesn\u0027t require that amount of longevity, many businesses want to know that their fundamental code base will be usable for the foreseeable future. Rust recognizes this and has made conscious design decisions around backwards compatibility and stability; it\u0027s a language designed for the next 40 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rust experience is larger than a language specification and a compiler; many aspects of creating and maintaining production-quality software are treated as first-class citizens. Multiple concurrent Rust toolchains can be installed and managed via rustup. Rust installations come with Cargo, a command line tool to manage dependencies, run tests, generate documentation, and more. Because dependencies, tests, and documentation are available by default, their usage is prevalent. crates.io is the community site for sharing and discovering Rust libraries. Any library published to crates.io will have its documentation built and published on docs.rs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the built-in tools, the Rust community has created a large number of development tools. Benchmarking, fuzzing, and property-based testing are all easily accessible and well-used in projects. Extra compiler lints are available from Clippy and automatic idiomatic formatting is provided by rustfmt. IDE support is healthy and growing more capable every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing beyond technical points, Rust has a vibrant, welcoming community. There are several official and unofficial avenues for people to get help, such as the chat, the user\u0027s forum, the Rust subreddit, and, of course, Stack Overflow questions and answers and chatroom. Rust has a code of conduct enforced by an awesome moderation team to make sure that the official spaces are welcoming, and most unofficial spaces also observe something similar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOffline, Rust has multiple conferences across the globe, such as RustConf, Rust Belt Rust, RustFest, Rust Latam, RustCon Asia, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust\u0027s strong type system and emphasis on memory safetyâall enforced at compile timeâmean that it\u0027s extremely common to get errors when compiling your code. This can be a frustrating feeling for programmers not used to such an opinionated programming language. However, the Rust developers have spent a large amount of time working to improve the error messages to ensure that they are clear and actionable. Don\u0027t let your eyes gloss over while reading Rust errors!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s especially common to hear someone complain that they\u0027ve been \"fighting the borrow checker.\" While these errors can be disheartening, it\u0027s important to recognize that each of the locations identified had the potential to introduce bugs and potential vulnerabilities in a language that didn\u0027t perform the same checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this example, we create a mutable string containing a name, then take a reference to the first three bytes of the name. While that reference is outstanding, we attempt to mutate the string by clearing it. There\u0027s now no guarantee that the reference points to valid data and dereferencing it could lead to undefined behavior, so the compiler stops us:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelpfully, the error message incorporates our code and tries its hardest to explain the problem, pointing out exact locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrototyping solutions in Rust can be challenging due to its statically-typed nature and because Rust requires covering 100% of the conditions, not just 99%. Edge cases must have applicable code, even when the programmer doesn\u0027t yet know what the happy path should do. During early development, these edge cases can often be addressed by causing the program to crash, and then rigorous error handling can be added at a later point. This is a different workflow than in languages such as Ruby, where developers often try out code in a REPL and then move that to a prototype without considering error cases at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust is still relatively new, which means that some desired libraries may not be available yet. The upside is there\u0027s plenty of fertile ground to develop these needed libraries, perhaps even taking advantage of recent developments in the relevant computer science fields. Due to this and Rust\u0027s capabilities, some of Rust\u0027s libraries, such as the regex crate, are the best-in-breed across any language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Rust has a strong commitment to stability and backwards compatibility, that doesn\u0027t imply the language is finalized. A specific problem may not have access to language features that would make it simpler to express or perhaps even possible to express. As an example, Rust has had asynchronous futures for over three years, but stable async / await support in the language itself is only a few months old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rust compiler is built on top of LLVM, which means that the number of target platforms will be smaller than C or C++.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of which programming languages you love now, there\u0027s bound to be something that excites or intrigues you about Rust. These are some of the reasons why I and others love Rust so much, and there\u0027s many more. If you are looking for extra structure in your project, faster or more efficient code, or the ability to write performant code more quickly and safely, it\u0027s time for you to see if Rust will be your next most-loved language!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-databases","html":"\u003cp\u003eThis course is part of Meta Database Engineer Professional Certificate\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaught in English\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome content may not be translated\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstructor: Taught by Meta Staff\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinancial aid available\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e64,497 already enrolled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncluded with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(1,001 reviews)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e96%\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended experience\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeginner level\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou do not need prior database experience.

The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively. An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure. A data structure is not only used for organising the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed.

The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArray Data Structure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure.

The order is First In First Out (FIFO). In the queue, items are inserted at one end and deleted from the other end. A good example of the queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing.

It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntroduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older readâwrite APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,[6] which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).[7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd\u0027s relational model. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\".[8] Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, SQL became the most widely used database language.[9][10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.[11] Since then, the standard has been revised multiple times to include a larger set of features and incorporate common extensions. Despite the existence of standards, virtually no implementations in existence adhere to it fully, and most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce after learning about the relational model from Edgar F. Codd[12] in the early 1970s.[13] This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM\u0027s original quasirelational database management system, System R, which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s.[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChamberlin and Boyce\u0027s first attempt at a relational database language was SQUARE (Specifying Queries in A Relational Environment), but it was difficult to use due to subscript/superscript notation. After moving to the San Jose Research Laboratory in 1973, they began work on a sequel to SQUARE.[12] The original name SEQUEL, which is widely regarded as a pun on QUEL, the query language of Ingres,[14] was later changed to SQL (dropping the vowels) because \"SEQUEL\" was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Engineering Limited company.[15] The label SQL later became the acronym for Structured Query Language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing commercial products based on their System R prototype, including System/38, SQL/DS, and IBM Db2, which were commercially available in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively.[16]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle Corporation) saw the potential of the concepts described by Codd, Chamberlin, and Boyce, and developed their own SQL-based RDBMS with aspirations of selling it to the U.S. Navy, Central Intelligence Agency, and other U.S. government agencies. In June 1979, Relational Software introduced one of the first commercially available implementations of SQL, Oracle V2 (Version2) for VAX computers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy 1986, ANSI and ISO standard groups officially adopted the standard \"Database Language SQL\" language definition. New versions of the standard were published in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011,[12] 2016 and most recently, 2023.[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSQL is designed for a specific purpose: to query data contained in a relational database. SQL is a set-based, declarative programming language, not an imperative programming language like C or BASIC. However, extensions to Standard SQL add procedural programming language functionality, such as control-of-flow constructs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the standard SQL/PSM extensions and proprietary SQL extensions, procedural and object-oriented programmability is available on many SQL platforms via DBMS integration with other languages. The SQL standard defines SQL/JRT extensions (SQL Routines and Types for the Java Programming Language) to support Java code in SQL databases. Microsoft SQL Server 2005 uses the SQLCLR (SQL Server Common Language Runtime) to host managed .NET assemblies in the database, while prior versions of SQL Server were restricted to unmanaged extended stored procedures primarily written in C. PostgreSQL lets users write functions in a wide variety of languagesâincluding Perl, Python, Tcl, JavaScript (PL/V8) and C.[19]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSQL implementations are incompatible between vendors and do not necessarily completely follow standards. In particular, date and time syntax, string concatenation, NULLs, and comparison case sensitivity vary from vendor to vendor. PostgreSQL[20] and Mimer SQL[21] strive for standards compliance, though PostgreSQL does not adhere to the standard in all cases. For example, the folding of unquoted names to lower case in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the SQL standard,[22] which says that unquoted names should be folded to upper case.[23] Thus, according to the standard, Foo should be equivalent to FOO, not foo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePopular implementations of SQL commonly omit support for basic features of Standard SQL, such as the DATE or TIME data types. The most obvious such examples, and incidentally the most popular commercial and proprietary SQL DBMSs, are Oracle (whose DATE behaves as DATETIME,[24][25] and lacks a TIME type)[26] and MS SQL Server (before the 2008 version). As a result, SQL code can rarely be ported between database systems without modifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral reasons for the lack of portability between database systems include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSQL was adopted as a standard by the ANSI in 1986 as SQL-86[28] and the ISO in 1987.[11] It is maintained by ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 32, Data management and interchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil 1996, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) data-management standards program certified SQL DBMS compliance with the SQL standard. Vendors now self-certify the compliance of their products.[29]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original standard declared that the official pronunciation for \"SQL\" was an initialism: /ËÉsËkjuËËÉl/ (\"ess cue el\").[9] Regardless, many English-speaking database professionals (including Donald Chamberlin himself[30]) use the acronym-like pronunciation of /ËsiËkwÉl/ (\"sequel\"),[31] mirroring the language\u0027s prerelease development name, \"SEQUEL\".[13][15][30] The SQL standard has gone through a number of revisions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe standard is commonly denoted by the pattern: ISO/IEC 9075-n:yyyy Part n: title, or, as a shortcut, ISO/IEC 9075. Interested parties may purchase the standards documents from ISO,[36] IEC, or ANSI. Some old drafts are freely available.[37][38][39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eISO/IEC 9075 is complemented by ISO/IEC 13249: SQL Multimedia and Application Packages and some Technical reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA distinction should be made between alternatives to SQL as a language, and alternatives to the relational model itself. Below are proposed relational alternatives to the SQL language. See navigational database and NoSQL for alternatives to the relational model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) was designed by a workgroup within IBM from 1988 to 1994. DRDA enables network-connected relational databases to cooperate to fulfill SQL requests.[41][42]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn interactive user or program can issue SQL statements to a local RDB and receive tables of data and status indicators in reply from remote RDBs. SQL statements can also be compiled and stored in remote RDBs as packages and then invoked by package name. This is important for the efficient operation of application programs that issue complex, high-frequency queries. It is especially important when the tables to be accessed are located in remote systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe messages, protocols, and structural components of DRDA are defined by the Distributed Data Management Architecture. Distributed SQL processing ala DRDA is distinctive from contemporary distributed SQL databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSQL deviates in several ways from its theoretical foundation, the relational model and its tuple calculus. In that model, a table is a set of tuples, while in SQL, tables and query results are lists of rows; the same row may occur multiple times, and the order of rows can be employed in queries (e.g., in the LIMIT clause). Critics argue that SQL should be replaced with a language that returns strictly to the original foundation: for example, see The Third Manifesto by Hugh Darwen and C.J. Date (2006, ISBN 0-321-39942-0).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly specifications did not support major features, such as primary keys. Result sets could not be named, and subqueries had not been defined. These were added in 1992.[12]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lack of sum types has been described as a roadblock to full use of SQL\u0027s user-defined types. JSON support, for example, needed to be added by a new standard in 2016.[43]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concept of Null is the subject of some debate. The Null marker indicates the absence of a value, and is distinct from a value of 0 for an integer column or an empty string for a text column. The concept of Nulls enforces the 3-valued-logic in SQL, which is a concrete implementation of the general 3-valued logic.[12]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother popular criticism is that it allows duplicate rows, making integration with languages such as Python, whose data types might make accurately representing the data difficult,[12] in terms of parsing and by the absence of modularity. This is usually avoided by declaring a primary key, or a unique constraint, with one or more columns that uniquely identify a row in the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a sense similar to objectârelational impedance mismatch, a mismatch occurs between the declarative SQL language and the procedural languages in which SQL is typically embedded.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SQL standard defines three kinds of data types (chapter 4.1.1 of SQL/Foundation):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstructed types are one of ARRAY, MULTISET, REF(erence), or ROW. User-defined types are comparable to classes in object-oriented language with their own constructors, observers, mutators, methods, inheritance, overloading, overwriting, interfaces, and so on. Predefined data types are intrinsically supported by the implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.djangoproject.com/","html":"\u003cp\u003eThe web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango makes it easier to build better web apps more quickly and with less code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet started with Django\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

We\u0027ll outline the main features, and show you some of the main building blocks of an Express application (although at this point you won\u0027t yet have a development environment in which to test it).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNode (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). As such, the environment omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a web server development perspective Node has a number of benefits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use Node.js to create a simple web server using the Node HTTP package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following example creates a web server that listens for any kind of HTTP request on the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/ â when a request is received, the script will respond with the string: \"Hello World\". If you have already installed node, you can follow these steps to try out the example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser; you should see the text \"Hello World\" in the upper left of an otherwise empty web page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther common web-development tasks are not directly supported by Node itself. If you want to add specific handling for different HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, POST, DELETE, etc.), separately handle requests at different URL paths (\"routes\"), serve static files, or use templates to dynamically create the response, Node won\u0027t be of much use on its own. You will either need to write the code yourself, or you can avoid reinventing the wheel and use a web framework!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpress is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks. It provides mechanisms to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Express itself is fairly minimalist, developers have created compatible middleware packages to address almost any web development problem. There are libraries to work with cookies, sessions, user logins, URL parameters, POST data, security headers, and many more. You can find a list of middleware packages maintained by the Express team at Express Middleware (along with a list of some popular 3rd party packages).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: This flexibility is a double edged sword. There are middleware packages to address almost any problem or requirement, but working out the right packages to use can sometimes be a challenge. There is also no \"right way\" to structure an application, and many examples you might find on the Internet are not optimal, or only show a small part of what you need to do in order to develop a web application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNode was initially released, for Linux only, in 2009. The npm package manager was released in 2010, and native Windows support was added in 2012. Delve into Wikipedia if you want to know more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpress was initially released in November 2010 and is currently on major version 4 of the API. You can check out the changelog for information about changes in the current release, and GitHub for more detailed historical release notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe popularity of a web framework is important because it is an indicator of whether it will continue to be maintained, and what resources are likely to be available in terms of documentation, add-on libraries, and technical support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere isn\u0027t any readily-available and definitive measure of the popularity of server-side frameworks (although you can estimate popularity using mechanisms like counting the number of GitHub projects and StackOverflow questions for each platform). A better question is whether Node and Express are \"popular enough\" to avoid the problems of unpopular platforms. Are they continuing to evolve? Can you get help if you need it? Is there an opportunity for you to get paid work if you learn Express?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on the number of high profile companies that use Express, the number of people contributing to the codebase, and the number of people providing both free and paid for support, then yes, Express is a popular framework!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb frameworks often refer to themselves as \"opinionated\" or \"unopinionated\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpinionated frameworks are those with opinions about the \"right way\" to handle any particular task. They often support rapid development in a particular domain (solving problems of a particular type) because the right way to do anything is usually well-understood and well-documented. However they can be less flexible at solving problems outside their main domain, and tend to offer fewer choices for what components and approaches they can use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnopinionated frameworks, by contrast, have far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal, or even what components should be used. They make it easier for developers to use the most suitable tools to complete a particular task, albeit at the cost that you need to find those components yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpress is unopinionated. You can insert almost any compatible middleware you like into the request handling chain, in almost any order you like. You can structure the app in one file or multiple files, and using any directory structure. You may sometimes feel that you have too many choices!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a traditional data-driven website, a web application waits for HTTP requests from the web browser (or other client). When a request is received the application works out what action is needed based on the URL pattern and possibly associated information contained in POST data or GET data. Depending on what is required it may then read or write information from a database or perform other tasks required to satisfy the request. The application will then return a response to the web browser, often dynamically creating an HTML page for the browser to display by inserting the retrieved data into placeholders in an HTML template.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpress provides methods to specify what function is called for a particular HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) and URL pattern (\"Route\"), and methods to specify what template (\"view\") engine is used, where template files are located, and what template to use to render a response. You can use Express middleware to add support for cookies, sessions, and users, getting POST/GET parameters, etc. You can use any database mechanism supported by Node (Express does not define any database-related behavior).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following sections explain some of the common things you\u0027ll see when working with Express and Node code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst lets consider the standard Express Hello World example (we discuss each part of this below, and in the following sections).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: If you have Node and Express already installed (or if you install them as shown in the next article), you can save this code in a text file called app.js and run it in a bash command prompt by calling:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enode ./app.js\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first two lines require() (import) the express module and create an Express application. This object, which is traditionally named app, has methods for routing HTTP requests, configuring middleware, rendering HTML views, registering a template engine, and modifying application settings that control how the application behaves (e.g. the environment mode, whether route definitions are case sensitive, etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle part of the code (the three lines starting with app.get) shows a route definition. The app.get() method specifies a callback function that will be invoked whenever there is an HTTP GET request with a path (\u0027/\u0027) relative to the site root. The callback function takes a request and a response object as arguments, and calls send() on the response to return the string \"Hello World!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final block starts up the server on a specified port (\u00273000\u0027) and prints a log comment to the console. With the server running, you could go to localhost:3000 in your browser to see the example response returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node\u0027s require() function. Express itself is a module, as are the middleware and database libraries that we use in our Express applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe code below shows how we import a module by name, using the Express framework as an example. First we invoke the require() function, specifying the name of the module as a string (\u0027express\u0027), and calling the returned object to create an Express application. We can then access the properties and functions of the application object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also create your own modules that can be imported in the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: You will want to create your own modules, because this allows you to organize your code into manageable parts â a monolithic single-file application is hard to understand and maintain. Using modules also helps you manage your namespace, because only the variables you explicitly export are imported when you use a module.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make objects available outside of a module you just need to expose them as additional properties on the exports object. For example, the square.js module below is a file that exports area() and perimeter() methods:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can import this module using require(), and then call the exported method(s) as shown:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: You can also specify an absolute path to the module (or a name, as we did initially).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to export a complete object in one assignment instead of building it one property at a time, assign it to module.exports as shown below (you can also do this to make the root of the exports object a constructor or other function):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: You can think of exports as a shortcut to module.exports within a given module. In fact, exports is just a variable that gets initialized to the value of module.exports before the module is evaluated. That value is a reference to an object (empty object in this case). This means that exports holds a reference to the same object referenced by module.exports. It also means that by assigning another value to exports it\u0027s no longer bound to module.exports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a lot more information about modules see Modules (Node API docs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript code frequently uses asynchronous rather than synchronous APIs for operations that may take some time to complete. A synchronous API is one in which each operation must complete before the next operation can start. For example, the following log functions are synchronous, and will print the text to the console in order (First, Second).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy contrast, an asynchronous API is one in which the API will start an operation and immediately return (before the operation is complete). Once the operation finishes, the API will use some mechanism to perform additional operations. For example, the code below will print out \"Second, First\" because even though setTimeout() method is called first, and returns immediately, the operation doesn\u0027t complete for several seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing non-blocking asynchronous APIs is even more important on Node than in the browser because Node is a single-threaded event-driven execution environment. \"Single threaded\" means that all requests to the server are run on the same thread (rather than being spawned off into separate processes). This model is extremely efficient in terms of speed and server resources, but it does mean that if any of your functions call synchronous methods that take a long time to complete, they will block not just the current request, but every other request being handled by your web application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a number of ways for an asynchronous API to notify your application that it has completed. The most common way is to register a callback function when you invoke the asynchronous API, that will be called back when the operation completes. This is the approach used above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Using callbacks can be quite \"messy\" if you have a sequence of dependent asynchronous operations that must be performed in order because this results in multiple levels of nested callbacks. This problem is commonly known as \"callback hell\". This problem can be reduced by good coding practices (see http://callbackhell.com/), using a module like async, or refactoring the code to native JavaScript features like Promises and async/await. Node offers the utils.promisify function to do the callback â Promise conversion ergonomically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: A common convention for Node and Express is to use error-first callbacks. In this convention, the first value in your callback functions is an error value, while subsequent arguments contain success data. There is a good explanation of why this approach is useful in this blog: The Node.js Way - Understanding Error-First Callbacks (fredkschott.com).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our Hello World Express example (see above), we defined a (callback) route handler function for HTTP GET requests to the site root (\u0027/\u0027).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe callback function takes a request and a response object as arguments. In this case, the method calls send() on the response to return the string \"Hello World!\" There are a number of other response methods for ending the request/response cycle, for example, you could call res.json() to send a JSON response or res.sendFile() to send a file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: You can use any argument names you like in the callback functions; when the callback is invoked the first argument will always be the request and the second will always be the response. It makes sense to name them such that you can identify the object you\u0027re working with in the body of the callback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Express application object also provides methods to define route handlers for all the other HTTP verbs, which are mostly used in exactly the same way:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echeckout(), copy(), delete(), get(), head(), lock(), merge(), mkactivity(), mkcol(), move(), m-search(), notify(), options(), patch(), post(), purge(), put(), report(), search(), subscribe(), trace(), unlock(), unsubscribe().\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a special routing method, app.all(), which will be called in response to any HTTP method. This is used for loading middleware functions at a particular path for all request methods. The following example (from the Express documentation) shows a handler that will be executed for requests to /secret irrespective of the HTTP verb used (provided it is supported by the http module).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoutes allow you to match particular patterns of characters in a URL, and extract some values from the URL and pass them as parameters to the route handler (as attributes of the request object passed as a parameter).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften it is useful to group route handlers for a particular part of a site together and access them using a common route-prefix (e.g. a site with a Wiki might have all wiki-related routes in one file and have them accessed with a route prefix of /wiki/). In Express this is achieved by using the express.Router object. For example, we can create our wiki route in a module named wiki.js, and then export the Router object, as shown below:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Adding routes to the Router object is just like adding routes to the app object (as shown previously).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo use the router in our main app file we would then require() the route module (wiki.js), then call use() on the Express application to add the Router to the middleware handling path. The two routes will then be accessible from /wiki/ and /wiki/about/.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll show you a lot more about working with routes, and in particular about using the Router, later on in the linked section Routes and controllers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiddleware is used extensively in Express apps, for tasks from serving static files to error handling, to compressing HTTP responses. Whereas route functions end the HTTP request-response cycle by returning some response to the HTTP client, middleware functions typically perform some operation on the request or response and then call the next function in the \"stack\", which might be more middleware or a route handler. The order in which middleware is called is up to the app developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: The middleware can perform any operation, execute any code, make changes to the request and response object, and it can also end the request-response cycle. If it does not end the cycle then it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function (or the request will be left hanging).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost apps will use third-party middleware in order to simplify common web development tasks like working with cookies, sessions, user authentication, accessing request POST and JSON data, logging, etc. You can find a list of middleware packages maintained by the Express team (which also includes other popular 3rd party packages). Other Express packages are available on the npm package manager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo use third party middleware you first need to install it into your app using npm. For example, to install the morgan HTTP request logger middleware, you\u0027d do this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could then call use() on the Express application object to add the middleware to the stack:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Middleware and routing functions are called in the order that they are declared. For some middleware the order is important (for example if session middleware depends on cookie middleware, then the cookie handler must be added first). It is almost always the case that middleware is called before setting routes, or your route handlers will not have access to functionality added by your middleware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can write your own middleware functions, and you are likely to have to do so (if only to create error handling code). The only difference between a middleware function and a route handler callback is that middleware functions have a third argument next, which middleware functions are expected to call if they are not that which completes the request cycle (when the middleware function is called, this contains the next function that must be called).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can add a middleware function to the processing chain for all responses with app.use(), or for a specific HTTP verb using the associated method: app.get(), app.post(), etc. Routes are specified in the same way for both cases, though the route is optional when calling app.use().\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe example below shows how you can add the middleware function using both approaches, and with/without a route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Above we declare the middleware function separately and then set it as the callback. In our previous route handler function we declared the callback function when it was used. In JavaScript, either approach is valid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Express documentation has a lot more excellent documentation about using and writing Express middleware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use the express.static middleware to serve static files, including your images, CSS and JavaScript (static() is the only middleware function that is actually part of Express). For example, you would use the line below to serve images, CSS files, and JavaScript files from a directory named \u0027public\u0027 at the same level as where you call node:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny files in the public directory are served by adding their filename (relative to the base \"public\" directory) to the base URL. So for example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can call static() multiple times to serve multiple directories. If a file cannot be found by one middleware function then it will be passed on to the subsequent middleware (the order that middleware is called is based on your declaration order).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also create a virtual prefix for your static URLs, rather than having the files added to the base URL. For example, here we specify a mount path so that the files are loaded with the prefix \"/media\":\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, you can load the files that are in the public directory from the /media path prefix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: See also Serving static files in Express.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErrors are handled by one or more special middleware functions that have four arguments, instead of the usual three: (err, req, res, next). For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese can return any content required, but must be called after all other app.use() and routes calls so that they are the last middleware in the request handling process!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpress comes with a built-in error handler, which takes care of any remaining errors that might be encountered in the app. This default error-handling middleware function is added at the end of the middleware function stack. If you pass an error to next() and you do not handle it in an error handler, it will be handled by the built-in error handler; the error will be written to the client with the stack trace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: The stack trace is not included in the production environment. To run it in production mode you need to set the environment variable NODE_ENV to \u0027production\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: HTTP404 and other \"error\" status codes are not treated as errors. If you want to handle these, you can add a middleware function to do so. For more information see the FAQ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information see Error handling (Express docs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpress apps can use any database mechanism supported by Node (Express itself doesn\u0027t define any specific additional behavior/requirements for database management). There are many options, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to use these you have to first install the database driver using npm. For example, to install the driver for the popular NoSQL MongoDB you would use the command:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe database itself can be installed locally or on a cloud server. In your Express code you require the driver, connect to the database, and then perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. The example below (from the Express documentation) shows how you can find \"mammal\" records using MongoDB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis works with older versions of MongoDB version ~ 2.2.33:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor MongoDB version 3.0 and up:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother popular approach is to access your database indirectly, via an Object Relational Mapper (\"ORM\"). In this approach you define your data as \"objects\" or \"models\" and the ORM maps these through to the underlying database format. This approach has the benefit that as a developer you can continue to think in terms of JavaScript objects rather than database semantics, and that there is an obvious place to perform validation and checking of incoming data.

Templates are often used to create HTML, but can also create other types of documents. Express has support for a number of template engines, each with its own strengths for addressing particular use cases (relative comparisons can easily be found via Internet search).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn your application settings code you set the template engine to use and the location where Express should look for templates using the \u0027views\u0027 and \u0027view engine\u0027 settings, as shown below (you will also have to install the package containing your template library too!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe appearance of the template will depend on what engine you use. Assuming that you have a template file named \"index.\u003ctemplate_extension\u003e\" that contains placeholders for data variables named \u0027title\u0027 and \"message\", you would call Response.render() in a route handler function to create and send the HTML response:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information see Using template engines with Express (Express docs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpress makes no assumptions in terms of structure or what components you use. Routes, views, static files, and other application-specific logic can live in any number of files with any directory structure. While it is perfectly possible to have the whole Express application in one file, typically it makes sense to split your application into files based on function (e.g. account management, blogs, discussion boards) and architectural problem domain (e.g. model, view or controller if you happen to be using an MVC architecture).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a later topic we\u0027ll use the Express Application Generator, which creates a modular app skeleton that we can easily extend for creating web applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCongratulations, you\u0027ve completed the first step in your Express/Node journey! You should now understand Express and Node\u0027s main benefits, and roughly what the main parts of an Express app might look like (routes, middleware, error handling, and template code). You should also understand that with Express being an unopinionated framework, the way you pull these parts together and the libraries that you use are largely up to you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course Express is deliberately a very lightweight web application framework, so much of its benefit and potential comes from third party libraries and features. We\u0027ll look at those in more detail in the following articles. In our next article we\u0027re going to look at setting up a Node development environment, so that you can start seeing some Express code in action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis page was last modified on Mar 1, 2024 by MDN contributors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour blueprint for a better internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisit Mozilla Corporationâs not-for-profit parent, the Mozilla Foundation.

More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning), achieving automation eventually. Using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as \"memory\", \"search\" and \"stimulus\".[2]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.[3] For example, social media recommender systems rely on heuristics in such a way that, although widely characterized as \"algorithms\" in 21st century popular media, cannot deliver correct results due to the nature of the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time[4] and in a well-defined formal language[5] for calculating a function.[6] Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),[7] the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite[8] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\"[9] and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround 825 AD, Persian scientist and polymath Muá¸¥ammad ibn MÅ«sÄ al-KhwÄrizmÄ« wrote kitÄb al-á¸¥isÄb al-hindÄ« (\"Book of Indian computation\") and kitab al-jam\u0027 wa\u0027l-tafriq al-á¸¥isÄb al-hindÄ« (\"Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic\"). Both of these texts are lost in the original Arabic at this time. However, his other book on algebra remains.[1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the early 12th century, Latin translations of said al-Khwarizmi texts involving the HinduâArabic numeral system and arithmetic appeared: Liber Alghoarismi de practica arismetrice (attributed to John of Seville) and Liber Algorismi de numero Indorum (attributed to Adelard of Bath).[2] Hereby, alghoarismi or algorismi is the Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi\u0027s name; the text starts with the phrase Dixit Algorismi (\"Thus spoke Al-Khwarizmi\").[3]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround 1230, the English word algorism is attested and then by Chaucer in 1391, English adopted the French term.[4][5][clarification needed] In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word á¼ÏÎ¹Î¸Î¼ÏÏ (arithmos, \"number\"; cf. \"arithmetic\"), the Latin word was altered to algorithmus.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne informal definition is \"a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations\",[11][need quotation to verify] which would include all computer programs (including programs that do not perform numeric calculations), and (for example) any prescribed bureaucratic procedure[12] or cook-book recipe.[13] In general, a program is an algorithm only if it stops eventually[14]âeven though infinite loops may sometimes prove desirable. Boolos, Jeffrey \u0026 1974, 1999 define an algorithm to be a set of instructions for determining an output, given explicitly, in a form that can be followed by either a computing machine, or a human who could only carry out specific elementary operations on symbols.[15]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concept of algorithm is also used to define the notion of decidabilityâa notion that is central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules. In logic, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to the customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain implementing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or in a mechanical device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince antiquity, step-by-step procedures for solving mathematical problems have been attested. This includes Babylonian mathematics (around 2500 BC),[16] Egyptian mathematics (around 1550 BC),[16] Indian mathematics (around 800 BC and later; e.g. Shulba Sutras, Kerala School, and BrÄhmasphuá¹­asiddhÄnta),[17][18] The Ifa Oracle (around 500 BC), Greek mathematics (around 240 BC, e.g. sieve of Eratosthenes and Euclidean algorithm),[19] and Arabic mathematics (9th century, e.g. cryptographic algorithms for code-breaking based on frequency analysis).[20] The first cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code was developed by Al-Kindi, a 9th-century Arab mathematician, in A Manuscript On Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest codebreaking algorithm.[20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earliest evidence of algorithms is found in the Babylonian mathematics of ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). A Sumerian clay tablet found in Shuruppak near Baghdad and dated to c.â2500 BC described the earliest division algorithm.[16] During the Hammurabi dynasty c.â1800 â c.â1600 BC, Babylonian clay tablets described algorithms for computing formulas.[21] Algorithms were also used in Babylonian astronomy. Babylonian clay tablets describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlgorithms for arithmetic are also found in ancient Egyptian mathematics, dating back to the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus c.â1550 BC.[16] Algorithms were later used in ancient Hellenistic mathematics. Two examples are the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which was described in the Introduction to Arithmetic by Nicomachus,[23][19]:âCh 9.2â and the Euclidean algorithm, which was first described in Euclid\u0027s Elements (c.â300 BC).[19]:âCh 9.1â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolter credits the invention of the weight-driven clock as \"The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]\", in particular, the verge escapement[24] that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. \"The accurate automatic machine\"[25] led immediately to \"mechanical automata\" beginning in the 13th century and finally to \"computational machines\"âthe difference engine and analytical engines of Charles Babbage and Countess Ada Lovelace, mid-19th century.[26] Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computerâBabbage\u0027s analytical engine, the first device considered a real Turing-complete computer instead of just a calculatorâand is sometimes called \"history\u0027s first programmer\" as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage\u0027s second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBell and Newell (1971) indicate that the Jacquard loom (1801), precursor to Hollerith cards (punch cards, 1887), and \"telephone switching technologies\" were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers.[27] By the mid-19th century the telegraph, the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as \"dots and dashes\" a common sound. By the late 19th century, the ticker tape (c.â1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the teleprinter (c.â1910) with its punched-paper use of Baudot code on tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelephone-switching networks of electromechanical relays (invented 1835) was behind the work of George Stibitz (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the \"burdensome\u0027 use of mechanical calculators with gears. \"He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device\".[28] The mathematician Martin Davis supported the particular importance of the electromechanical relay.[29]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1928, a partial formalization of the modern concept of algorithms began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) posed by David Hilbert. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define \"effective calculability\"[30] or \"effective method\".[31] Those formalizations included the GÃ¶delâHerbrandâKleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church\u0027s lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post\u0027s Formulation 1 of 1936, and Alan Turing\u0027s Turing machines of 1936â37 and 1939.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlgorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, programming languages or control tables (processed by interpreters). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in statements based on natural language. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer, but they are also often used as a way to define or document algorithms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given Turing machine program as a sequence of machine tables (see finite-state machine, state-transition table and control table for more), as flowcharts and drakon-charts (see state diagram for more), or as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called \"sets of quadruples\" (see Turing machine for more). Representations of algorithms can also be classified into three accepted levels of Turing machine description: high level description, implementation description, and formal description.[32] A high level description describes qualities of the algorithm itself, ignoring how it is implemented on the Turing machine.[32] An implementation description describes the general manner in which the machine moves its head and stores data in order to carry out the algorithm, but doesn\u0027t give exact states.[32] In the most detail, a formal description gives the exact state table and list of transitions of the Turing machine.[32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe graphical aid called a flowchart offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program corresponding to it). Like the program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The BÃ¶hmâJacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can \"nest\" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.[33]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, an algorithm which adds up the elements of a list of n numbers would have a time requirement of O ( n ) {\\displaystyle O(n)} , using big O notation. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the sum of all the elements so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of O ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle O(1)} , if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O ( n ) {\\displaystyle O(n)} if it is counted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or \u0027effort\u0027 than others. For example, a binary search algorithm (with cost O ( log â¡ n ) {\\displaystyle O(\\log n)} ) outperforms a sequential search (cost O ( n ) {\\displaystyle O(n)} ) when used for table lookups on sorted lists or arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe analysis, and study of algorithms is a discipline of computer science, and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific programming language or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually, pseudocode is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their algorithmic efficiency is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a \"one off\" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmpirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. Benchmarks may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization. Empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner.[34]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to FFT algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging.[35] In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.[36] Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlgorithm design refers to a method or a mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories, such as divide-and-conquer or dynamic programming within operation research. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns,[37] with examples including the template method pattern and the decorator pattern. One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is resource (run-time, memory usage) efficiency; the big O notation is used to describe e.g., an algorithm\u0027s run-time growth as the size of its input increases.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePer the ChurchâTuring thesis, any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be Turing complete. In fact, it has been demonstrated that Turing completeness requires only four instruction typesâconditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. However, Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while \"undisciplined\" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in \"spaghetti code\", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand \"it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language\".[38] Tausworthe augments the three BÃ¶hm-Jacopini canonical structures:[39] SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.[40] An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to proofs of correctness using mathematical induction.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor optimization problems there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlgorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute \"processes\" (USPTO 2006), so algorithms are not patentable (as in Gottschalk v. Benson). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in Diamond v. Diehr, the application of a simple feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of synthetic rubber was deemed patentable. The patenting of software is controversial,[45] and there are criticized patents involving algorithms, especially data compression algorithms, such as Unisys\u0027s LZW patent. Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see export of cryptography).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description in English prose, as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh-level description:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Quasi-)formal description: Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode or pidgin code:\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/","html":""},{"url":"https://thehackernews.com/","html":"Couldn\u0027t Connect"},{"url":"https://developer.apple.com/swift/","html":"\u003cp\u003eView in English\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatch the latest videos about Swift\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for all Apple platforms. Itâs easy to get started using Swift, with a concise-yet-expressive syntax and modern features youâll love. Swift code is safe by design and produces software that runs lightning-fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift is the result of the latest research on programming languages, combined with decades of experience building Apple platforms. Named parameters are expressed in a clean syntax that makes APIs in Swift even easier to read and maintain. Even better, you donât even need to type semi-colons. Inferred types make code cleaner and less prone to mistakes, while modules eliminate headers and provide namespaces. To best support international languages and emoji, strings are Unicode-correct and use a UTF-8-based encoding to optimize performance for a wide variety of use cases. Memory is managed automatically using tight, deterministic reference counting, keeping memory usage to a minimum without the overhead of garbage collection. You can even write concurrent code with simple, built-in keywords that define asynchronous behavior, making your code more readable and less error prone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeclare new types with modern, straightforward syntax. Provide default values for instance properties and define custom initializers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdd functionality to existing types using extensions, and cut down on boilerplate code with custom string interpolations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly extend your custom types to take advantage of powerful language features, such as automatic JSON encoding and decoding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerform powerful custom transformations using streamlined closures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese forward-thinking concepts result in a language thatâs fun and easy to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift has many other features to make your code more expressive:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift eliminates entire classes of unsafe code. Variables are always initialized before use, arrays and integers are checked for overflow, memory is automatically managed, and enforcement of exclusive access to memory guards against many programming mistakes. Syntax is tuned to make it easy to define your intent â for example, simple three-character keywords define a variable ( var ) or constant ( let ). And Swift heavily leverages value types, especially for commonly used types like Arrays and Dictionaries. This means that when you make a copy of something with that type, you know it wonât be modified elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother safety feature is that by default Swift objects can never be nil. In fact, the Swift compiler will stop you from trying to make or use a nil object with a compile-time error. This makes writing code much cleaner and safer, and prevents a huge category of runtime crashes in your apps. However, there are cases where nil is valid and appropriate. For these situations Swift has an innovative feature known as optionals. An optional may contain nil, but Swift syntax forces you to safely deal with it using the ? syntax to indicate to the compiler you understand the behavior and will handle it safely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse optionals when you might have an instance to return from a function, or you might not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeatures such as optional binding, optional chaining, and nil coalescing let you work safely and efficiently with optional values.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom its earliest conception, Swift was built to be fast. Using the incredibly high-performance LLVM compiler technology, Swift code is transformed into optimized machine code that gets the most out of modern hardware. The syntax and standard library have also been tuned to make the most obvious way to write your code also perform the best whether it runs in the watch on your wrist or across a cluster of servers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift is a successor to the C, C++, and Objective-C languages. It includes low-level primitives such as types, flow control, and operators. It also provides object-oriented features such as classes, protocols, and generics, giving Cocoa and Cocoa Touch developers the performance and power they demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift can open doors to the world of coding. In fact, it was designed to be anyoneâs first programming language, whether youâre still in school or exploring new career paths. For educators, Apple created free curriculum to teach Swift both in and out of the classroom. First-time coders can download Swift Playgrounds â an app for iPad and Mac that makes getting started with Swift code interactive and fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAspiring app developers can access free courses to learn to build their first apps in Xcode. And Apple Stores around the world host Today at Apple Coding \u0026 Apps sessions where you can get practical experience with Swift code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn more about Swift education resources from Apple\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift is developed in the open at Swift.org, with source code, a bug tracker, forums, and regular development builds available for everyone. This broad community of developers, both inside Apple as well as hundreds of outside contributors, work together to make Swift even more amazing. There is an even broader range of blogs, podcasts, conferences, and meetups where developers in the community share their experiences of how to realize the great potential of Swift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift already supports all Apple platforms and Linux, with community members actively working to port to even more platforms. With SourceKit-LSP, the community is also working to integrate Swift support into a wide-variety of developer tools. Weâre excited to see more ways in which Swift makes software safer and faster, while also making programming more fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Swift powers many new apps on Apple platforms, itâs also being used for a new class of modern server applications. Swift is perfect for use in server apps that need runtime safety, compiled performance, and a small memory footprint. To steer the direction of Swift for developing and deploying server applications, the community formed the Swift Server work group. The first product of this effort was SwiftNIO, a cross-platform asynchronous event-driven network application framework for high performance protocol servers and clients. It serves as the foundation for building additional server-oriented tools and technologies, including logging, metrics, and database drivers, which are all in active development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo learn more about the open source Swift community and the Swift Server work group, visit Swift.org.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch like Swift Playgrounds for iPad and Mac, playgrounds in Xcode make writing Swift code incredibly simple and fun. Type a line of code and the result appears immediately. You can then Quick Look the result from the side of your code, or pin that result directly below. The result view can display graphics, lists of results, or graphs of a value over time. You can open the Timeline Assistant to watch a complex view evolve and animate, great for experimenting with new UI code, or to play an animated SpriteKit scene as you code it. When youâve perfected your code in the playground, simply move that code into your project. Swift is also interactive when you use it in Terminal or to the Xcode LLDB debugging console. Use Swift syntax to evaluate and interact with your running app, or write new code to see how it works in a script-like environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift Package Manager is a single cross-platform tool for building, running, testing, and packaging your Swift libraries and executables. Swift packages are the best way to distribute libraries and source code to the Swift community. Configuration of packages is written in Swift itself, making it easy to configure targets, declare products, and manage package dependencies. Swift packages can also include custom commands that help build your projects and provide additional tooling. Swift Package Manager itself is actually built with Swift and included in the Swift open source project as a package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can create an entirely new application with Swift today, or begin using Swift code to implement new features and functionality in your app. Swift code coexists along side your existing Objective-C and C++ files in the same project, with access to your Objective-C and C++ APIs, making it easy to adopt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownload Xcode and learn how to build apps using Swift with documentation and sample code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eView resources\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb","html":"\u003cp\u003eThe official MongoDB driver for Node.js.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpgrading to version 6?

At the same time, they announced the posting on the s-news mailing list.[11] On December 5, 1997, R became a GNU project when version 0.60 was released.[12] On February 29, 2000, the first official 1.0 version was released.[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR packages are collections of functions, documentation, and data that expand R.[14] For example, packages add report features such as RMarkdown, knitr and Sweave.

However, some argue that using the pipe operator will produce code that is easier to read.[20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe R language has native support for object-oriented programming. There are two native frameworks, the so-called S3 and S4 systems.

In this article, we\u0027ll provide an overview of the basic concepts of OOP. We\u0027ll describe three main concepts: classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation. For now, we\u0027ll describe these concepts without reference to JavaScript in particular, so all the examples are given in pseudocode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: To be precise, the features described here are of a particular style of OOP called class-based or \"classical\" OOP. When people talk about OOP, this is generally the type that they mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, in JavaScript, we\u0027ll look at how constructors and the prototype chain relate to these OOP concepts, and how they differ. In the next article, we\u0027ll look at some additional features of JavaScript that make it easier to implement object-oriented programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject-oriented programming is about modeling a system as a collection of objects, where each object represents some particular aspect of the system. Objects contain both functions (or methods) and data. An object provides a public interface to other code that wants to use it but maintains its own private, internal state; other parts of the system don\u0027t have to care about what is going on inside the object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we model a problem in terms of objects in OOP, we create abstract definitions representing the types of objects we want to have in our system. For example, if we were modeling a school, we might want to have objects representing professors. Every professor has some properties in common: they all have a name and a subject that they teach. Additionally, every professor can do certain things: they can all grade a paper and they can introduce themselves to their students at the start of the year, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Professor could be a class in our system. The definition of the class lists the data and methods that every professor has.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn pseudocode, a Professor class could be written like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis defines a Professor class with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn its own, a class doesn\u0027t do anything: it\u0027s a kind of template for creating concrete objects of that type. Each concrete professor we create is called an instance of the Professor class. The process of creating an instance is performed by a special function called a constructor. We pass values to the constructor for any internal state that we want to initialize in the new instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally, the constructor is written out as part of the class definition, and it usually has the same name as the class itself:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis constructor takes two parameters, so we can initialize the name and teaches properties when we create a new concrete professor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have a constructor, we can create some professors. Programming languages often use the keyword new to signal that a constructor is being called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis creates two objects, both instances of the Professor class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose in our school we also want to represent students. Unlike professors, students can\u0027t grade papers, don\u0027t teach a particular subject, and belong to a particular year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, students do have a name and may also want to introduce themselves, so we might write out the definition of a student class like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be helpful if we could represent the fact that students and professors share some properties, or more accurately, the fact that on some level, they are the same kind of thing. Inheritance lets us do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe start by observing that students and professors are both people, and people have names and want to introduce themselves. We can model this by defining a new class Person, where we define all the common properties of people. Then, Professor and Student can both derive from Person, adding their extra properties:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, we would say that Person is the superclass or parent class of both Professor and Student. Conversely, Professor and Student are subclasses or child classes of Person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might notice that introduceSelf() is defined in all three classes. The reason for this is that while all people want to introduce themselves, the way they do so is different:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe might have a default implementation of introduceSelf() for people who aren\u0027t students or professors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis feature - when a method has the same name but a different implementation in different classes - is called polymorphism. When a method in a subclass replaces the superclass\u0027s implementation, we say that the subclass overrides the version in the superclass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObjects provide an interface to other code that wants to use them but maintain their own internal state. The object\u0027s internal state is kept private, meaning that it can only be accessed by the object\u0027s own methods, not from other objects. Keeping an object\u0027s internal state private, and generally making a clear division between its public interface and its private internal state, is called encapsulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a useful feature because it enables the programmer to change the internal implementation of an object without having to find and update all the code that uses it: it creates a kind of firewall between this object and the rest of the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, suppose students are allowed to study archery if they are in the second year or above. We could implement this just by exposing the student\u0027s year property, and other code could examine that to decide whether the student can take the course:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is, if we decide to change the criteria for allowing students to study archery - for example by also requiring the parent or guardian to give their permission - we\u0027d need to update every place in our system that performs this test. It would be better to have a canStudyArchery() method on Student objects, that implements the logic in one place:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat way, if we want to change the rules about studying archery, we only have to update the Student class, and all the code using it will still work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many OOP languages, we can prevent other code from accessing an object\u0027s internal state by marking some properties as private. This will generate an error if code outside the object tries to access them:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn languages that don\u0027t enforce access like this, programmers use naming conventions, such as starting the name with an underscore, to indicate that the property should be considered private.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we\u0027ve described some of the basic features of class-based object-oriented programming as implemented in languages like Java and C++.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the two previous articles, we looked at a couple of core JavaScript features: constructors and prototypes. These features certainly have some relation to some of the OOP concepts described above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s worth understanding the differences between these features and the \"classical\" OOP concepts described above. We\u0027ll highlight a couple of them here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, in class-based OOP, classes and objects are two separate constructs, and objects are always created as instances of classes. Also, there is a distinction between the feature used to define a class (the class syntax itself) and the feature used to instantiate an object (a constructor). In JavaScript, we can and often do create objects without any separate class definition, either using a function or an object literal. This can make working with objects much more lightweight than it is in classical OOP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, although a prototype chain looks like an inheritance hierarchy and behaves like it in some ways, it\u0027s different in others. When a subclass is instantiated, a single object is created which combines properties defined in the subclass with properties defined further up the hierarchy. With prototyping, each level of the hierarchy is represented by a separate object, and they are linked together via the __proto__ property. The prototype chain\u0027s behavior is less like inheritance and more like delegation. Delegation is a programming pattern where an object, when asked to perform a task, can perform the task itself or ask another object (its delegate) to perform the task on its behalf. In many ways, delegation is a more flexible way of combining objects than inheritance (for one thing, it\u0027s possible to change or completely replace the delegate at run time).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, constructors and prototypes can be used to implement class-based OOP patterns in JavaScript. But using them directly to implement features like inheritance is tricky, so JavaScript provides extra features, layered on top of the prototype model, that map more directly to the concepts of class-based OOP. These extra features are the subject of the next article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article has described the basic features of class-based object oriented programming, and briefly looked at how JavaScript constructors and prototypes compare with these concepts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next article, we\u0027ll look at the features JavaScript provides to support class-based object-oriented programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis page was last modified on Aug 2, 2023 by MDN contributors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour blueprint for a better internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisit Mozilla Corporationâs not-for-profit parent, the Mozilla Foundation.

It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.[7] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[8]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is commonly used to host open source software development projects.[9] As of January 2023[update], GitHub reported having over 100 million developers[10] and more than 420 million repositories,[11] including at least 28 million public repositories.[12] It is the world\u0027s largest source code host as of June 2023[update].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007.[13][14][15] The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a beta release.[16] GitHub has an annual keynote called GitHub Universe.[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, \"everyone is a manager\" (self-management).[18] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but the chief executive set salaries. (i.e. Individual or groups of company executive leaders decides on project aims and development, including funding)[19]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2014, GitHub, Inc. added a layer of middle management in response to serious harassment allegations against its senior leadership. As a result of the scandal, Tom Preston-Werner resigned from his position as CEO.[20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital[7] with a $750 million valuation.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of venture capital in a series B round. The lead investor was Sequoia Capital, and other investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital funds.[23][24] The round valued the company at approximately $2 billion.[25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of 2023,[update] GitHub was estimated to generate $1 billion in revenue.[2]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed as of 2007[update] and is located in San Francisco.[26]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once, and 4,600 had been merged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub,[27] and had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.[28]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories.[29] A year later, this number doubled.[30] ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of January to May 2011.[31] On January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.[32] By the end of the year, the number of repositories was twice as great, reaching 10 million repositories.[33]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan, its first outside of the U.S.[34] In 2016, GitHub was ranked No. 14 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[35] It was not featured on 2018, 2019, and 2020 lists.[36]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 28, 2018, GitHub fell victim to the third-largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history, with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about 1.35 terabits per second.[37]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 19, 2018, GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools.[38][39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 2012, Microsoft became a significant user of GitHub, using it to host open-source projects and development tools such as .NET Core, Chakra Core, MSBuild, PowerShell, PowerToys, Visual Studio Code, Windows Calculator, Windows Terminal and the bulk of its product documentation (now to be found on Microsoft Docs).[41][42]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion (~$8.96 billion in 2023). The deal closed on October 26, 2018.[43] GitHub continued to operate independently as a community, platform and business.[44] Under Microsoft, the service was led by Xamarin\u0027s Nat Friedman, reporting to Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI. Nat Friedman resigned November 3, 2021; he was replaced by Thomas Dohmke.[45]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere have been concerns from developers Kyle Simpson, JavaScript trainer and author, and Rafael Laguna, CEO at Open-Xchange over Microsoft\u0027s purchase, citing uneasiness over Microsoft\u0027s handling of previous acquisitions, such as Nokia\u0027s mobile business and Skype.[46][47]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis acquisition was in line with Microsoft\u0027s business strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, which has seen a larger focus on cloud computing services, alongside the development of and contributions to open-source software.[8][42][48] Harvard Business Review argued that Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access to its user base, so it can be used as a loss leader to encourage the use of its other development products and services.[49]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcerns over the sale bolstered interest in competitors: Bitbucket (owned by Atlassian), GitLab and SourceForge (owned by BIZX, LLC) reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to migrate projects from GitHub to their respective services.[50][51][52][53][54]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn September 2019, GitHub acquired Semmle, a code analysis tool.[55] In February 2020, GitHub launched in India under the name GitHub India Private Limited.[56] In March 2020, GitHub announced that they were acquiring npm, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.[57] The deal was closed on April 15, 2020.[58]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn early July 2020, the GitHub Archive Program was established to archive its open-source code in perpetuity.[59]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub\u0027s mascot is an anthropomorphized \"octocat\" with five octopus-like arms.[60][61] The character was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley as clip art to sell on iStock,[62] a website that enables designers to market royalty-free digital images. The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named Octopuss.[62] Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo (a use that the iStock license disallows), they negotiated with Oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image.[62]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub renamed Octopuss to Octocat,[62] and trademarked the character along with the new name.[60] Later, GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials; McEfee and various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the character, which are available on The Octodex.[63][64]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProjects on GitHub can be accessed and managed using the standard Git command-line interface; all standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows users to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git plugins are also available. In addition, the site provides social networking-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using wiki software called Gollum), and a social network graph to display how developers work on their versions (\"forks\") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone can browse and download public repositories, but only registered users can contribute content to repositories. With a registered user account, users can have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others\u0027 repositories, and review changes to code. GitHub began offering limited private repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project). Previously, only public repositories were free.[65][66][67] On April 14, 2020, GitHub made \"all of the core GitHub features\" free for everyone, including \"private repositories with unlimited collaborators.\"[68]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fundamental software that underpins GitHub is Git itself, written by Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. The additional software that provides the GitHub user interface was written using Ruby on Rails and Erlang by GitHub, Inc. developers Wanstrath,[69] Hyett, and Preston-Werner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary purpose of GitHub is to facilitate the version control and issue tracking aspects of software development. Labels, milestones, responsibility assignment, and a search engine are available for issue tracking. For version control, Git (and, by extension, GitHub) allows pull requests to propose changes to the source code. Users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them. In Git terminology, this action is called \"committing\" and one instance of it is a \"commit.\" A history of all commits is kept and can be viewed at a later time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub\u0027s Terms of Service do not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the Open Source Definition. The terms of service state, \"By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and fork your repositories.\"[84]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub Enterprise is a self-managed version of GitHub with similar functionality. It can be run on an organization\u0027s hardware or a cloud provider and has been available as of November 2011[update].[85] In November 2020, source code for GitHub Enterprise Server was leaked online in an apparent protest against DMCA takedown of youtube-dl. According to GitHub, the source code came from GitHub accidentally sharing the code with Enterprise customers themselves, not from an attack on GitHub servers.[86][87]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of 2008[update], GitHub has offered GitHub Pages, a static web hosting service for blogs, project documentation,[88][89] and books.[90]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll GitHub Pages content is stored in a Git repository as files served to visitors verbatim or in Markdown format. GitHub is integrated with Jekyll static website and blog generator and GitHub continuous integration pipelines. Each time the content source is updated, Jekyll regenerates the website and automatically serves it via GitHub Pages infrastructure.[91]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the rest of GitHub, it includes free and paid service tiers. Websites generated through this service are hosted either as subdomains of the github.io domain or can be connected to custom domains bought through a third-party domain name registrar.[92] GitHub Pages supports HTTPS encryption.[93][94]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub also operates a pastebin-style site called Gist, which is for code snippets, as opposed to GitHub proper, which is usually used for larger projects.[16] Tom Preston-Werner dÃ©buted the feature at a Ruby conference in 2008.[95]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGist builds on the traditional simple concept of a pastebin by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and TLS encryption for private pastes. Because each \"gist\" is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using Git.[96]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnregistered users could upload Gists until March 19, 2018, when uploading Gists was restricted to logged-in users, reportedly to mitigate spamming on the page of recent Gists.[97]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGists\u0027 URLs use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a revision history, which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a \"split\" and \"unified\" view. Like repositories, Gists can be forked, \"starred\", i.e., publicly bookmarked, and commented on. The count of revisions, stars, and forks is indicated on the gist page.[98]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to more than a dozen popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with Bitnami, Crowdflower, DigitalOcean, DNSimple, HackHands, Namecheap, Orchestrate, Screenhero, SendGrid, Stripe, Travis CI, and Unreal Engine to launch the program.[99]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program[100] to train and encourage students to grow technology communities at their universities. The Campus Experts program is open to university students 18 years and older worldwide.[101] GitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student-oriented events and communities, Campus Experts are given access to training, funding, and additional resources to run events and grow their communities. To become a Campus Expert, applicants must complete an online training course with multiple modules to develop community leadership skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub also provides some software as a service (SaaS) integrations for adding extra features to projects. Those services include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub Sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on GitHub.[105] The public beta was announced on May 23, 2019, and the project accepts waitlist registrations. The Verge said that GitHub Sponsors \"works exactly like Patreon\" because \"developers can offer various funding tiers that come with different perks, and they\u0027ll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their work\" except with \"zero fees to use the program.\" Furthermore, GitHub offers incentives for early adopters during the first year: it pledges to cover payment processing costs and match sponsorship payments up to $5,000 per developer. Furthermore, users can still use similar services like Patreon and Open Collective and link to their websites.[106][107]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July 2020, GitHub stored a February archive of the site[59] in an abandoned mountain mine in Svalbard, Norway, part of the Arctic World Archive and not far from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The archive contained the code of all active public repositories, as well as that of dormant but significant public repositories. The 21TB of data was stored on piqlFilm archival film reels as matrix (2D) barcode (Boxing barcode), and is expected to last 500â1,000 years.[108][109][110][111]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe GitHub Archive Program is also working with partners on Project Silica, in an attempt to store all public repositories for 10,000 years. It aims to write archives into the molecular structure of quartz glass platters, using a high-precision petahertz pulse laser, i.e. one that pulses a quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) times per second.[111]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn March 2014, GitHub programmer Julie Ann Horvath alleged that founder and CEO Tom Preston-Werner and his wife, Theresa, engaged in a pattern of harassment against her that led to her leaving the company.[112] In April 2014, GitHub released a statement denying Horvath\u0027s allegations.[113][114][115] However, following an internal investigation, GitHub confirmed the claims. GitHub\u0027s CEO Chris Wanstrath wrote on the company blog, \"The investigation found Tom Preston-Werner in his capacity as GitHub\u0027s CEO acted inappropriately, including confrontational conduct, disregard of workplace complaints, insensitivity to the impact of his spouse\u0027s presence in the workplace, and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office.\"[116] Preston-Werner subsequently resigned from the company.[117] The firm then announced it would implement new initiatives and trainings \"to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately.\"[117]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn July 25, 2019, a developer based in Iran wrote on Medium that GitHub had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to GitHub pages.[118] Soon after, GitHub confirmed that it was now blocking developers in Iran, Crimea, Cuba, North Korea, and Syria from accessing private repositories.[119] However, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user\u0027s account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub\u0027s vision is to be the global platform for developer collaboration, no matter where developers reside. As a result, we take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law. This includes keeping public repositories services, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions.[120][121]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevelopers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of VPNs and IP proxies to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources.[122]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn December 4, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide manuals.[123] After a day, Russia withdrew its block,[124] and GitHub began blocking specific content and pages in Russia.[125] On December 31, 2014, India blocked GitHub.com along with 31 other websites over pro-ISIS content posted by users;[126] the block was lifted three days later.[127] On October 8, 2016, Turkey blocked GitHub to prevent email leakage of a hacked account belonging to the country\u0027s energy minister.[128]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 26, 2015, a large-scale DDoS attack was launched against GitHub.com that lasted for just under five days.[129] The attack, which appeared to originate from China, primarily targeted GitHub-hosted user content describing methods of circumventing Internet censorship.[130][131][132]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn April 19, 2020, Chinese police detained Chen Mei and Cai Wei (volunteers for Terminus 2049, a project hosted on GitHub), and accused them of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\" Cai and Chen archived news articles, interviews, and other materials published on Chinese media outlets and social media platforms that have been removed by censors in China.[133]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGitHub has a $200,000 contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the use of their on-site product GitHub Enterprise Server. This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO Nat Friedman stated, \"The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and not financially material for our company.\" He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to \"nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by the current administration.\"[134] In response, at least 150 GitHub employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ICE. As of November 13, 2019, five workers had resigned over the contract.[135][136][137]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ICE contract dispute came into focus again in June 2020 due to the company\u0027s decision to abandon \"master/slave\" branch terminology, spurred by the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter movement.[138] Detractors of GitHub describe the branch renaming to be a form of performative activism and have urged GitHub to cancel their ICE contract instead.[139] An open letter from members of the open source community was shared on GitHub in December 2019, demanding that the company drop its contract with ICE and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships. The letter has been signed by more than 700 people.[140]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January 2021, GitHub fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues following the January 6 United States Capitol attack, calling some of the rioters \"Nazis\".[141] After an investigation, GitHub\u0027s COO said there were \"significant errors of judgment and procedure\" with the company\u0027s decision to fire the employee. As a result of the investigation, GitHub reached out to the employee, and the company\u0027s head of human resources resigned.[142][143]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2023, parts of the social media platform Twitter were uploaded onto GitHub. The leak was first reported by the New York Times and was part of a legal filing Twitter submitted to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Twitter claimed that the postings infringed on copyright property owned by them, and asked the court for information to identify the user who posted the source code to GitHub, under the username \"FreeSpeechEnthusiast\".[144]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinus Torvalds, the original developer of the Git software, has highly praised GitHub by stating \"The hosting of github [sic] is excellent. They\u0027ve done a good job on that. I think GitHub should be commended enormously for making open source project hosting so easy.\" However, he also sharply criticized the implementation of GitHubâs merging interface, stating that \"Git comes with a nice pull-request generation module, but GitHub instead decided to replace it with their own totally inferior version. As a result, I consider GitHub useless for these kinds of things. It\u0027s fine for hosting, but the pull requests and the online commit editing, are just pure garbage.\"[145][146]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.programiz.com/c-programming","html":"\u003cp\u003eTry Programiz PRO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn C practically and Get Certified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn C practically and Get Certified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC is one of the foundational programming languages used in the development of compilers, operating systems, and embedded systems where speed and efficiency matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is considered the best language to start because it provides a strong understanding of fundamental coding concepts like data types, variables, loops, and functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a competitive base salary, there is a significant demand for C developers in high-stake fields where high performance is essential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this guide, we will cover:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are simply looking to learn C step-by-step, you can follow our free tutorials in the next section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese tutorials will provide you with a solid foundation in C and prepare you for the next step in your career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting Started with C\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour First C Program\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Comments\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Variables, Constants and Literals\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Data Types\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Input Output (I/O)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Programming Operators\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC if...else Statement\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC for Loop\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC while and do...while Loop\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC break and continue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC switch Statement\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC goto Statement\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Functions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC User-defined functions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypes of User-defined Functions in C Programming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Recursion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Storage Class\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Arrays\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Multidimensional Arrays\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePass arrays to a function in C\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Pointers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelationship Between Arrays and Pointers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Pass Addresses and Pointers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Dynamic Memory Allocation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Array and Pointer Examples\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Programming Strings\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eString Manipulations In C Programming Using Library Functions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eString Examples in C Programming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC struct\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC structs and Pointers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Structure and Function\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Unions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC File Handling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Files Examples\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Keywords and Identifiers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Precedence And Associativity Of Operators\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Bitwise Operators\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Preprocessor and Macros\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC Standard Library Functions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC enums\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether C is the right choice depends on what you want to accomplish and your career goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are new to coding, learning C can help you build a strong programming foundation.

In doing that, PyCharm by JetBrains saves you a lot of time by taking care of the routine and by making a number of other tasks such as debugging and visualization easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, youâll learn about:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article assumes that youâre familiar with Python development and already have some form of Python installed on your system. Python 3.6 will be used for this tutorial. Screenshots and demos provided are for macOS. Because PyCharm runs on all major platforms, you may see slightly different UI elements and may need to modify certain commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyCharm comes in three editions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more details on their differences, check out the PyCharm Editions Comparison Matrix by JetBrains. The company also has special offers for students, teachers, open source projects, and other cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownload Sample Project: Click here to download the sample project youâll use to explore the project-focused features of PyCharm in this tutorial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article will use PyCharm Community Edition 2019.1 as itâs free and available on every major platform. Only the section about the professional features will use PyCharm Professional Edition 2019.1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recommended way of installing PyCharm is with the JetBrains Toolbox App. With its help, youâll be able to install different JetBrains products or several versions of the same product, update, rollback, and easily remove any tool when necessary. Youâll also be able to quickly open any project in the right IDE and version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo install the Toolbox App, refer to the documentation by JetBrains. It will automatically give you the right instructions depending on your OS. In case it didnât recognize your OS correctly, you can always find it from the drop down list on the top right section:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter installing, launch the app and accept the user agreement. Under the Tools tab, youâll see a list of available products. Find PyCharm Community there and click Install:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoilÃ ! You have PyCharm available on your machine. If you donât want to use the Toolbox app, then you can also do a stand-alone installation of PyCharm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaunch PyCharm, and youâll see the import settings popup:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyCharm will automatically detect that this is a fresh install and choose Do not import settings for you. Click OK, and PyCharm will ask you to select a keymap scheme. Leave the default and click Next: UI Themes on the bottom right:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyCharm will then ask you to choose a dark theme called Darcula or a light theme. Choose whichever you prefer and click Next: Launcher Script:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIâll be using the dark theme Darcula throughout this tutorial. You can find and install other themes as plugins, or you can also import them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the next page, leave the defaults and click Next: Featured plugins. There, PyCharm will show you a list of plugins you may want to install because most users like to use them. Click Start using PyCharm, and now you are ready to write some code!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn PyCharm, you do everything in the context of a project. Thus, the first thing you need to do is create one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter installing and opening PyCharm, you are on the welcome screen. Click Create New Project, and youâll see the New Project popup:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecify the project location and expand the Project Interpreter drop down. Here, you have options to create a new project interpreter or reuse an existing one. Choose New environment using. Right next to it, you have a drop down list to select one of Virtualenv, Pipenv, or Conda, which are the tools that help to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python environments for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are free to select whichever you like, but Virtualenv is used for this tutorial. If you choose to, you can specify the environment location and choose the base interpreter from the list, which is a list of Python interpreters (such as Python2.7 and Python3.6) installed on your system. Usually, the defaults are fine. Then you have to select boxes to inherit global site-packages to your new environment and make it available to all other projects. Leave them unselected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick Create on the bottom right and you will see the new project created:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will also see a small Tip of the Day popup where PyCharm gives you one trick to learn at each startup. Go ahead and close this popup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is now time to start a new Python program. Type Cmd+N if you are on Mac or Alt+Ins if you are on Windows or Linux. Then, choose Python File. You can also select File â New from the menu. Name the new file guess_game.py and click OK. You will see a PyCharm window similar to the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor our test code, letâs quickly code up a simple guessing game in which the program chooses a number that the user has to guess. For every guess, the program will tell if the userâs guess was smaller or bigger than the secret number. The game ends when the user guesses the number. Hereâs the code for the game:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eType this code directly rather than copying and pasting. Youâll see something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, PyCharm provides Intelligent Coding Assistance with code completion, code inspections, on-the-fly error highlighting, and quick-fix suggestions. In particular, note how when you typed main and then hit tab, PyCharm auto-completed the whole main clause for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso note how, if you forget to type if before the condition, append .if, and then hit Tab, PyCharm fixes the if clause for you. The same is true with True.while. Thatâs PyCharmâs Postfix completions working for you to help reduce backward caret jumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that youâve coded up the game, itâs time for you to run it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have three ways of running this program:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse any one of the options above to run the program, and youâll see the Run Tool pane appear at the bottom of the window, with your code output showing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlay the game for a little bit to see if you can find the number guessed. Pro tip: start with 50.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you find the number? If so, you may have seen something weird after you found the number. Instead of printing the congratulations message and exiting, the program seems to start over. Thatâs a bug right there. To discover why the program starts over, youâll now debug the program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, place a breakpoint by clicking on the blank space to the left of line number 8:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will be the point where the program will be suspended, and you can start exploring what went wrong from there on. Next, choose one of the following three ways to start debugging:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterwards, youâll see a Debug window open at the bottom:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollow the steps below to debug the program:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotice that the current line is highlighted in blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee that random_int and its value are listed in the Debug window. Make a note of this number. (In the picture, the number is 85.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHit F8 to execute the current line and step over to the next one. You can also use F7 to step into the function in the current line, if necessary. As you continue executing the statements, the changes in the variables will be automatically reflected in the Debugger window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotice that there is the Console tab right next to the Debugger tab that opened. This Console tab and the Debugger tab are mutually exclusive. In the Console tab, you will be interacting with your program, and in the Debugger tab you will do the debugging actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitch to the Console tab to enter your guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eType the number shown, and then hit Enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitch back to the Debugger tab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHit F8 again to evaluate the if statement. Notice that you are now on line 14. But wait a minute! Why didnât it go to the line 11? The reason is that the if statement on line 10 evaluated to False. But why did it evaluate to False when you entered the number that was chosen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook carefully at line 10 and notice that we are comparing user_guess with the wrong thing. Instead of comparing it with random_int, we are comparing it with randint, the function that was imported from the random package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChange it to random_int, restart the debugging, and follow the same steps again. You will see that, this time, it will go to line 11, and line 10 will evaluate to True:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCongratulations! You fixed the bug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo application is reliable without unit tests. PyCharm helps you write and run them very quickly and comfortably. By default, unittest is used as the test runner, but PyCharm also supports other testing frameworks such as pytest, nose, doctest, tox, and trial. You can, for example, enable pytest for your project like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this example, weâll be using the default test runner unittest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same project, create a file called calculator.py and put the following Calculator class in it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyCharm makes it very easy to create tests for your existing code. With the calculator.py file open, execute any one of the following that you like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoose Create New Testâ¦, and you will see the following window:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave the defaults of Target directory, Test file name, and Test class name. Select both of the methods and click OK. Voila! PyCharm automatically created a file called test_calculator.py and created the following stub tests for you in it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun the tests using one of the methods below:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYouâll see the tests window open on the bottom with all the tests failing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotice that you have the hierarchy of the test results on the left and the output of the terminal on the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, implement test_add by changing the code to the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun the tests again, and youâll see that one test passed and the other failed. Explore the options to show passed tests, to show ignored tests, to sort tests alphabetically, and to sort tests by duration:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that the sleep(0.1) method that you see in the GIF above is intentionally used to make one of the tests slower so that sorting by duration works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese single file projects are great for examples, but youâll often work on much larger projects over a longer period of time. In this section, youâll take a look at how PyCharm works with a larger project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo explore the project-focused features of PyCharm, youâll use the Alcazar web framework that was built for learning purposes. To continue following along, download the sample project locally:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownload Sample Project: Click here to download the sample project youâll use to explore the project-focused features of PyCharm in this tutorial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have the project downloaded and extracted locally, open it in PyCharm using one of the following methods:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter either of these steps, find the folder containing the project on your computer and open it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this project contains a virtual environment, then PyCharm will automatically use this virtual environment and make it the project interpreter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you need to configure a different virtualenv, then open Preferences on Mac by pressing Cmd+, or Settings on Windows or Linux by pressing Ctrl+Alt+S and find the Project: ProjectName section. Open the drop-down and choose Project Interpreter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoose the virtualenv from the drop-down list. If itâs not there, then click on the settings button to the right of the drop-down list and then choose Addâ¦. The rest of the steps should be the same as when we were creating a new project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a big project where itâs difficult for a single person to remember where everything is located, itâs very important to be able to quickly navigate and find what you looking for. PyCharm has you covered here as well. Use the project you opened in the section above to practice these shortcuts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the navigation, the following shortcuts may save you a lot of time:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more details, see the official documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVersion control systems such as Git and Mercurial are some of the most important tools in the modern software development world. So, it is essential for an IDE to support them. PyCharm does that very well by integrating with a lot of popular VC systems such as Git (and Github), Mercurial, Perforce and, Subversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Git is used for the following examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo enable VCS integration. Go to VCS â VCS Operations Popupâ¦ from the menu on the top or press Ctrl+V on Mac or Alt+` on Windows or Linux. Choose Enable Version Control Integrationâ¦. Youâll see the following window open:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoose Git from the drop down list, click OK, and you have VCS enabled for your project. Note that if you opened an existing project that has version control enabled, then PyCharm will see that and automatically enable it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if you go to the VCS Operations Popupâ¦, youâll see a different popup with the options to do git add, git stash, git branch, git commit, git push and more:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you canât find what you need, you can most probably find it by going to VCS from the top menu and choosing Git, where you can even create and view pull requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are two features of VCS integration in PyCharm that I personally use and enjoy a lot! Letâs say you have finished your work and want to commit it. Go to VCS â VCS Operations Popupâ¦ â Commitâ¦ or press Cmd+K on Mac or Ctrl+K on Windows or Linux. Youâll see the following window open:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this window, you can do the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can feel magical and fast, especially if youâre used to doing everything manually on the command line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you work in a team, merge conflicts do happen. When somebody commits changes to a file that youâre working on, but their changes overlap with yours because both of you changed the same lines, then VCS will not be able to figure out if it should choose your changes or those of your teammate. So youâll get these unfortunate arrows and symbols:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis looks strange, and itâs difficult to figure out which changes should be deleted and which ones should stay. PyCharm to the rescue! It has a much nicer and cleaner way of resolving conflicts. Go to VCS in the top menu, choose Git and then Resolve conflictsâ¦. Choose the file whose conflicts you want to resolve and click on Merge. You will see the following window open:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the left column, you will see your changes. On the right one, the changes made by your teammate. Finally, in the middle column, you will see the result. The conflicting lines are highlighted, and you can see a little X and \u003e\u003e/\u003c\u003c right beside those lines. Press the arrows to accept the changes and the X to decline. After you resolve all those conflicts, click the Apply button:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the GIF above, for the first conflicting line, the author declined his own changes and accepted those of his teammates. Conversely, the author accepted his own changes and declined his teammatesâ for the second conflicting line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThereâs a lot more that you can do with the VCS integration in PyCharm. For more details, see this documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find almost everything you need for development in PyCharm. If you canât, there is most probably a plugin that adds that functionality you need to PyCharm. For example, they can:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, IdeaVim adds Vim emulation to PyCharm. If you like Vim, this can be a pretty good combination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaterial Theme UI changes the appearance of PyCharm to a Material Design look and feel:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVue.js adds support for Vue.js projects. Markdown provides the capability to edit Markdown files within the IDE and see the rendered HTML in a live preview. You can find and install all of the available plugins by going to the Preferences â Plugins on Mac or Settings â Plugins on Windows or Linux, under the Marketplace tab:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you canât find what you need, you can even develop your own plugin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you canât find the right plugin and donât want to develop your own because thereâs already a package in PyPI, then you can add it to PyCharm as an external tool. Take Flake8, the code analyzer, as an example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, install flake8 in your virtualenv with pip install flake8 in the Terminal app of your choice. You can also use the one integrated into PyCharm:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, go to Preferences â Tools on Mac or Settings â Tools on Windows/Linux, and then choose External Tools. Then click on the little + button at the bottom (1). In the new popup window, insert the details as shown below and click OK for both windows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, Program (2) refers to the Flake8 executable that can be found in the folder /bin of your virtual environment. Arguments (3) refers to which file you want to analyze with the help of Flake8. Working directory is the directory of your project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could hardcode the absolute paths for everything here, but that would mean that you couldnât use this external tool in other projects. You would be able to use it only inside one project for one file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you need to use something called Macros. Macros are basically variables in the format of $name$ that change according to your context. For example, $FileName$ is first.py when youâre editing first.py, and it is second.py when youâre editing second.py. You can see their list and insert any of them by clicking on the Insert Macroâ¦ buttons. Because you used macros here, the values will change according to the project youâre currently working on, and Flake8 will continue to do its job properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to use it, create a file example.py and put the following code in it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt deliberately breaks some of the Flake8 rules. Right-click the background of this file. Choose External Tools and then Flake8. VoilÃ ! The output of the Flake8 analysis will appear at the bottom:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to make it even better, you can add a shortcut for it. Go to Preferences on Mac or to Settings on Windows or Linux. Then, go to Keymap â External Tools â External Tools. Double-click Flake8 and choose Add Keyboard Shortcut. Youâll see this window:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the image above, the shortcut is Ctrl+Alt+A for this tool. Add your preferred shortcut in the textbox and click OK for both windows. Now you can now use that shortcut to analyze the file youâre currently working on with Flake8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyCharm Professional is a paid version of PyCharm with more out-of-the-box features and integrations. In this section, youâll mainly be presented with overviews of its main features and links to the official documentation, where each feature is discussed in detail. Remember that none of the following features is available in the Community edition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyCharm has extensive support for Django, one of the most popular and beloved Python web frameworks. To make sure that itâs enabled, do the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that youâve enabled Django support, your Django development journey will be a lot easier in PyCharm:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more details on Django support, see the official documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModern database development is a complex task with many supporting systems and workflows. Thatâs why JetBrains, the company behind PyCharm, developed a standalone IDE called DataGrip for that. Itâs a separate product from PyCharm with a separate license.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, PyCharm supports all the features that are available in DataGrip through a plugin called Database tools and SQL, which is enabled by default. With the help of it, you can query, create and manage databases whether theyâre working locally, on a server, or in the cloud. The plugin supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, MariaDB, Oracle, Apache Cassandra, and others. For more information on what you can do with this plugin, check out the comprehensive documentation on the database support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDjango Channels, asyncio, and the recent frameworks like Starlette are examples of a growing trend in asynchronous Python programming. While itâs true that asynchronous programs do bring a lot of benefits to the table, itâs also notoriously hard to write and debug them. In such cases, Thread Concurrency Visualization can be just what the doctor ordered because it helps you take full control over your multi-threaded applications and optimize them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck out the comprehensive documentation of this feature for more details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of optimization, profiling is another technique that you can use to optimize your code. With its help, you can see which parts of your code are taking most of the execution time. A profiler runs in the following order of priority:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you donât have vmprof or yappi installed, then itâll fall back to the standard cProfile. Itâs well-documented, so I wonât rehash it here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython is not only a language for general and web programming. It also emerged as the best tool for data science and machine learning over these last years thanks to libraries and tools like NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter, and more. With such powerful libraries available, you need a powerful IDE to support all the functions such as graphing and analyzing those libraries have. PyCharm provides everything you need as thoroughly documented here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne common cause of bugs in many applications is that development and production environments differ. Although, in most cases, itâs not possible to provide an exact copy of the production environment for development, pursuing it is a worthy goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith PyCharm, you can debug your application using an interpreter that is located on the other computer, such as a Linux VM. As a result, you can have the same interpreter as your production environment to fix and avoid many bugs resulting from the difference between development and production environments. Make sure to check out the official documentation to learn more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyCharm is one of best, if not the best, full-featured, dedicated, and versatile IDEs for Python development.

These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web.[12] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal was a \"language for the masses\",[14] \"to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites\".[15] Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][16]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript.[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft first released JScript in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Netscape Navigator.[18][19] These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of \"best viewed in Netscape\" and \"best viewed in Internet Explorer\" logos for several years.[18][20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrendan Eich later said of this period: \"It\u0027s still kind of a sidekick language. It\u0027s considered slow or annoying. People do pop-ups or those scrolling messages in the old status bar at the bottom of your old browser.\"[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the effort to fully standardize the language was undermined by Microsoft gaining an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer\u0027s market share reached 95%.[21] This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition.[23][24] The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT),[25] so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.[26]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmbitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a stand-alone JavaScript runtime system.[28][29] As of 2018, Node had been used by millions of developers,[30] and npm had the most modules of any package manager in the world.[31]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub,[32] and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots.[32] Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process.[33][34] Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually.[32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been created to aid the development process.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"JavaScript\" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States.[36][37] The trademark was originally issued to Sun Microsystems on 6 May 1997, and was transferred to Oracle when they acquired Sun in 2009.[38]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.[10] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user\u0027s device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework as part of their client-side scripting.[39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejQuery is by far the most-used.[39] Other notable ones include Angular, Bootstrap, Lodash, Modernizr, React, Underscore, and Vue.[39] Multiple options can be used in conjunction, such as jQuery and Bootstrap.[40]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the term \"Vanilla JS\" was coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft\u0027s Internet Information Services,[42][43] but they were small niches.[44] Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.[44]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElectron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents[45] and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.[46]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.[47][48][49]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.[50]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model and Web IDL bindings.[51] However, the use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers; for example, the V8 engine is a core component of the Node.js runtime system.[52]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe JavaScript engine must be embedded within a runtime system (either a web browser or a standalone system) to provide objects and methods by which scripts can interact with the larger environment. This includes the necessary APIs for I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. The runtime also provides the ability to import scripts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript is a single-threaded language. The runtime processes messages from a queue one at a time, and it calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function\u0027s arguments and local variables. The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function\u0027s needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as \"run to completion\" because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language\u0027s concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program I/O is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for example, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.[54]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe notable standalone runtimes are Node.js, Deno, and Bun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with var; block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.[55]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.[56]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValues are cast to strings like the following:[56]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValues are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining toString and valueOf functions on the prototype for string and number casting respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency.[57][56] For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften also mentioned is {} + [] resulting in 0 (number). This is misleading: the {} is interpreted as an empty code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary + operator. If the expression is wrapped in parentheses - ({} + []) - the curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is \"[object Object]\" as expected.[56]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string.[58] JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.[59]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript includes an eval function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou make prototype objects, and then ... make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don\u0027t need classes to make lots of similar objects... Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that?[60]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (obj.x \u003d 10) and bracket notation (obj[\u0027x\u0027] \u003d 10). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object\u0027s prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a for...in loop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for inheritance.[61] It is possible to simulate many class-based features with prototypes in JavaScript.[62]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunctions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with new will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the Object prototype).[63] ECMAScript 5 offers the Object.create method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the Object prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to null).[64] The constructor\u0027s prototype property determines the object used for the new object\u0027s internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript\u0027s built-in constructors, such as Array or Object, also have prototypes that can be modified. While it is possible to modify the Object prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the Object prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified.[65]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike in many object-oriented languages, in JavaScript there is no distinction between a function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling. When a function is called as a method of an object, the function\u0027s local this keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript functions are first-class; a function is considered to be an object.[66] As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as .call() and .bind().[67]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nested function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: the lexical scope of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes.[68]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript also supports anonymous functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of Role[69] patterns like Traits[70][71] and Mixins.[72] Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the this keyword within its function body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via call or apply to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object\u0027s context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript is a zero-index language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function. The function can access them through formal parameters and also through the local arguments object. Variadic functions can also be created by using the bind method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike in many scripting languages, arrays and objects (associative arrays in other languages) can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax. In fact, these literals form the basis of the JSON data format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a manner similar to Perl, JavaScript also supports regular expressions, which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.[73]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript supports promises and Async/await for handling asynchronous operations.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA built-in Promise object provides functionality for handling promises and associating handlers with an asynchronous action\u0027s eventual result. Recently, the JavaScript specification introduced combinator methods, which allow developers to combine multiple JavaScript promises and do operations based on different scenarios. The methods introduced are: Promise.race, Promise.all, Promise.allSettled and Promise.any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsync/await allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function. Asynchronous, non-blocking code can be written, with minimal overhead, structured similarly to traditional synchronous, blocking code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, some JavaScript engines supported these non-standard features:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVariables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var,[75] let[76] or const[77] keywords. Variables defined without keywords will be defined at the global scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote the comments in the examples above, all of which were preceded with two forward slashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no built-in Input/output functionality in JavaScript, instead it is provided by the run-time environment. The ECMAScript specification in edition 5.1 mentions that \"there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results\".[78] However, most runtime environments have a console object that can be used to print output.[79] Here is a minimalist \"Hello, World!\" program in JavaScript in a runtime environment with a console object:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn HTML documents, a program like this is required for an output:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA simple recursive function to calculate the factorial of a natural number:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn anonymous function (or lambda):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis example shows that, in JavaScript, function closures capture their non-local variables by reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrow functions were first introduced in 6th Edition - ECMAScript 2015. They shorten the syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. Arrow functions are anonymous, so a variable is needed to refer to them in order to invoke them after their creation, unless surrounded by parenthesis and executed immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExample of arrow function:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn JavaScript, objects can be created as instances of a class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject class example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn JavaScript, objects can be instantiated directly from a function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject functional example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVariadic function demonstration (arguments is a special variable):[80]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately-invoked function expressions are often used to create closures. Closures allow gathering properties and methods in a namespace and making some of them private:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerator objects (in the form of generator functions) provide a function which can be called, exited, and re-entered while maintaining internal context (statefulness).[81]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript can export and import from modules:[82]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExport example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImport example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sample code displays various JavaScript features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following output should be displayed in the browser window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one website do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are subsets of general JavaScriptâADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)âthat provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements).[83][84] Closure Toolkit is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.[85]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContent Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Website, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim\u0027s authorization. One important solution to XSS vulnerabilities is HTML sanitization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome browsers include partial protection against reflected XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server-side can fully prevent XSS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.[86]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker\u0027s site tricks the victim\u0027s browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker\u0027s site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"JavaScript hijacking\" is a type of CSRF attack in which a \u003cscript\u003e tag on an attacker\u0027s site exploits a page on the victim\u0027s site that returns private information such as JSON or JavaScript. Possible solutions include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevelopers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some implications are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePackage management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program\u0027s dependencies upon other developers\u0027 program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133,000 websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability.[89] \"The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago.\"[89] Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer KoÃ§ulu removed his repository from npm. This caused tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.[90][91]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows. These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user\u0027s system. This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application. For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system\u0027s API with superuser privileges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese flaws have affected major browsers including Firefox,[92] Internet Explorer,[93] and Safari.[94]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlugins, such as video players, Adobe Flash, and the wide range of ActiveX controls enabled by default in Microsoft Internet Explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via JavaScript (such flaws have been exploited in the past).[95][96]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Windows Vista, Microsoft has attempted to contain the risks of bugs such as buffer overflows by running the Internet Explorer process with limited privileges.[97] Google Chrome similarly confines its page renderers to their own \"sandbox\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files. Such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the Web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncorrectly granting privileges to JavaScript from the Web has played a role in vulnerabilities in both Internet Explorer[98] and Firefox.[99] In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft demoted JScript\u0027s privileges in Internet Explorer.[100]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft Windows allows JavaScript source files on a computer\u0027s hard drive to be launched as general-purpose, non-sandboxed programs (see: Windows Script Host). This makes JavaScript (like VBScript) a theoretically viable vector for a Trojan horse, although JavaScript Trojan horses are uncommon in practice.[101][failed verification]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, a JavaScript-based proof-of-concept implementation of a rowhammer attack was described in a paper by security researchers.[102][103][104][105]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, a JavaScript-based attack via browser was demonstrated that could bypass ASLR. It is called \"ASLRâCache\" or AnC.[106][107]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, the paper that announced the Spectre attacks against Speculative Execution in Intel and other processors included a JavaScript implementation.[108]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImportant tools have evolved with the language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA common misconception is that JavaScript is directly related to Java. Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They are also typically sandboxed, and JavaScript was designed with Java\u0027s syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript\u0027s standard library follows Java\u0027s naming conventions, and JavaScript\u0027s Math and Date objects are based on classes from Java 1.0.[111]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth languages first appeared in 1995, but Java was developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and JavaScript by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript\u0027s typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java\u0027s objects are class-based, while JavaScript\u0027s are prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJSON is a data format derived from JavaScript; hence the name JavaScript Object Notation. It is a widely-used format supported by many other programming languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany websites are JavaScript-heavy, so transpilers have been created to convert code written in other languages, which can aid the development process.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypeScript and CoffeeScript are two notable languages that transpile to JavaScript.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWebAssembly is a newer language with a bytecode format designed to complement JavaScript, especially the performance-critical portions of web page scripts. All of the major JavaScript engines support WebAssembly,[112] which runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003easm.js is a subset of JavaScript that served as the forerunner of WebAssembly.[113]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.edx.org/","html":"\u003cp\u003eTry a course for free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirthday presents for all â save 30% on select programs now through May 20, 2024.

PostgreSQL features transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties, automatically updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures.[13] It is supported on all major operating systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, macOS, and Windows, and handles a range of workloads from single machines to data warehouses or web services with many concurrent users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PostgreSQL Global Development Group focuses only on developing a database engine and closely related components. This core is, technically, what comprises PostgreSQL itself, but there is an extensive developer community and ecosystem that provides other important feature sets that might, traditionally, be provided by a proprietary software vendor. These include special-purpose database engine features, like those needed to support a geospatial[14] or temporal[15] database or features which emulate other database products.[16][17][18][19] Also available from third parties are a wide variety of user and machine interface features, such as graphical user interfaces[20][21][22] or load balancing and high availability toolsets.[23] The large third-party PostgreSQL support network of people, companies, products, and projects, even though not part of The PostgreSQL Development Group, are essential to the PostgreSQL database engine\u0027s adoption and use and make up the PostgreSQL ecosystem writ large.[24]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley.[25][26] In 1996, the project was renamed PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL and the alias Postgres.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL evolved from the Ingres project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, Michael Stonebraker, left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres.[25] He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the Turing Award in 2014 for these and other projects,[28] and techniques pioneered in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support data types.[29] These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships â something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using rules. POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.[30]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM SIGMOD Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers[31] and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2[32] on June 30, 1994 â primarily a cleanup â the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an MIT License variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced POSTQUEL query language interpreter, which could be interactively used with a console application named monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. The monitor console was also replaced by psql. Yu and Chen announced the first version (0.01) to beta testers on May 5, 1995. Version 1.0 of Postgres95 was announced on September 5, 1995, with a more liberal license that enabled the software to be freely modifiable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn July 8, 1996, Marc Fournier at Hub.org Networking Services provided the first non-university development server for the open-source development effort.[3] With the participation of Bruce Momjian and Vadim B. Mikheev, work began to stabilize the code inherited from Berkeley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. The online presence at the website PostgreSQL.org began on October 22, 1996.[33] The first PostgreSQL release formed version 6.0 on January 29, 1997. Since then developers and volunteers around the world have maintained the software as The PostgreSQL Global Development Group.[2]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe project continues to make releases available under its free and open-source software PostgreSQL License. Code comes from contributions from proprietary vendors, support companies, and open-source programmers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL manages concurrency through multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), which gives each transaction a \"snapshot\" of the database, allowing changes to be made without affecting other transactions. This largely eliminates the need for read locks, and ensures the database maintains ACID principles. PostgreSQL offers four levels of transaction isolation: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read and Serializable. Because PostgreSQL is immune to dirty reads, requesting a Read Uncommitted transaction isolation level provides read committed instead. PostgreSQL supports full serializability via the serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) method.[34] The PostreSQL MVCC implementation is prone to performance issues that require tuning when under a heavy write load which updates existing rows.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL includes built-in binary replication based on shipping the changes (write-ahead logs (WAL)) to replica nodes asynchronously, with the ability to run read-only queries against these replicated nodes. This allows splitting read traffic among multiple nodes efficiently. Earlier replication software that allowed similar read scaling normally relied on adding replication triggers to the master, increasing load.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL includes built-in synchronous replication[36] that ensures that, for each write transaction, the master waits until at least one replica node has written the data to its transaction log. Unlike other database systems, the durability of a transaction (whether it is asynchronous or synchronous) can be specified per-database, per-user, per-session or even per-transaction. This can be useful for workloads that do not require such guarantees, and may not be wanted for all data as it slows down performance due to the requirement of the confirmation of the transaction reaching the synchronous standby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStandby servers can be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous standby servers can be specified in the configuration which determines which servers are candidates for synchronous replication. The first in the list that is actively streaming will be used as the current synchronous server. When this fails, the system fails over to the next in line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSynchronous multi-master replication is not included in the PostgreSQL core. Postgres-XC which is based on PostgreSQL provides scalable synchronous multi-master replication.[37] It is licensed under the same license as PostgreSQL. A related project is called Postgres-XL. Postgres-R is yet another fork.[38] Bidirectional replication (BDR) is an asynchronous multi-master replication system for PostgreSQL.[39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTools such as repmgr make managing replication clusters easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral asynchronous trigger-based replication packages are available. These remain useful even after introduction of the expanded core abilities, for situations where binary replication of a full database cluster is inappropriate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL includes built-in support for regular B-tree and hash table indexes, and four index access methods: generalized search trees (GiST), generalized inverted indexes (GIN), Space-Partitioned GiST (SP-GiST)[41] and Block Range Indexes (BRIN). In addition, user-defined index methods can be created, although this is quite an involved process. Indexes in PostgreSQL also support the following features:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL schemas are namespaces, allowing objects of the same kind and name to co-exist in a single database. They are not to be confused with a database schema -- the abstract, structural, organizational specification which defines how every table\u0027s data relates to data within other tables. All PostgreSQL database objects, except for a few global objects such as roles and tablespaces, exist within a schema. They cannot be nested, schemas cannot contain schemas. The permission system controls access to schemas and their content. By default, newly created databases have only a single schema called public but other schemas can be added and the public schema isn\u0027t mandatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA search_path setting determines the order in which PostgreSQL checks schemas for unqualified objects (those without a prefixed schema). By default, it is set to $user, public ($user refers to the currently connected database user). This default can be set on a database or role level, but as it is a session parameter, it can be freely changed (even multiple times) during a client session, affecting that session only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon-existent schemas, or other schemas not accessible to the logged-in user, that are listed in search_path are silently skipped during object lookup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew objects are created in whichever valid schema (one that can be accessed) appears first in the search_path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wide variety of native data types are supported, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, users can create their own data types which can usually be made fully indexable via PostgreSQL\u0027s indexing infrastructures â GiST, GIN, SP-GiST. Examples of these include the geographic information system (GIS) data types from the PostGIS project for PostgreSQL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also a data type called a domain, which is the same as any other data type but with optional constraints defined by the creator of that domain. This means any data entered into a column using the domain will have to conform to whichever constraints were defined as part of the domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA data type that represents a range of data can be used which are called range types. These can be discrete ranges (e.g. all integer values 1 to 10) or continuous ranges (e.g., any time between 10:00 am and 11:00 am). The built-in range types available include ranges of integers, big integers, decimal numbers, time stamps (with and without time zone) and dates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCustom range types can be created to make new types of ranges available, such as IP address ranges using the inet type as a base, or float ranges using the float data type as a base. Range types support inclusive and exclusive range boundaries using the [] and () characters respectively. (e.g., [4,9) represents all integers starting from and including 4 up to but not including 9.) Range types are also compatible with existing operators used to check for overlap, containment, right of etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew types of almost all objects inside the database can be created, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTables can be set to inherit their characteristics from a parent table. Data in child tables will appear to exist in the parent tables, unless data is selected from the parent table using the ONLY keyword, i.e. SELECT * FROM ONLY parent_table;. Adding a column in the parent table will cause that column to appear in the child table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInheritance can be used to implement table partitioning, using either triggers or rules to direct inserts to the parent table into the proper child tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis feature is not fully supported. In particular, table constraints are not currently inheritable. All check constraints and not-null constraints on a parent table are automatically inherited by its children. Other types of constraints (unique, primary key, and foreign key constraints) are not inherited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInheritance provides a way to map the features of generalization hierarchies depicted in entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) directly into the PostgreSQL database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL can link to other systems to retrieve data via foreign data wrappers (FDWs).[45] These can take the form of any data source, such as a file system, another relational database management system (RDBMS), or a web service. This means that regular database queries can use these data sources like regular tables, and even join multiple data-sources together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL supports a binary communication protocol that allows applications to connect to the database server. The protocol is versioned (currently 3.0, as of PostgreSQL 7.4) and has a detailed specification.[46]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe official client implementation of this communication protocol is a C API, libpq.[47] In addition, the officially supported ECPG tool allows SQL commands to be embedded in C code.[48] Both are part of the standard PostgreSQL distribution.[49]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird-party libraries for connecting to PostgreSQL are available for many programming languages, including C++,[50] Java,[51] Julia,[52][53][54] Python,[55] Node.js,[56] Go,[57] and Rust.[58]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProcedural languages allow developers to extend the database with custom subroutines (functions), often called stored procedures. These functions can be used to build database triggers (functions invoked on modification of certain data) and custom data types and aggregate functions.[59] Procedural languages can also be invoked without defining a function, using a DO command at SQL level.[60]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanguages are divided into two groups: Procedures written in safe languages are sandboxed and can be safely created and used by any user. Procedures written in unsafe languages can only be created by superusers, because they allow bypassing a database\u0027s security restrictions, but can also access sources external to the database. Some languages like Perl provide both safe and unsafe versions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL has built-in support for three procedural languages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, PostgreSQL allows procedural languages to be loaded into the database through extensions. Three language extensions are included with PostgreSQL to support Perl, Tcl, and Python. For Python, the current Python 3 is used, and the discontinued Python 2 is no longer supported as of PostgreSQL 15. Both were supported previously, defaulting to Python 2, while old and new versions couldn\u0027t be used in the same session.[61] External projects provide support for many other languages,[62] including PL/Java, JavaScript (PL/V8), PL/Julia,[54] PL/R,[63] PL/Ruby, and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriggers are events triggered by the action of SQL data manipulation language (DML) statements. For example, an INSERT statement might activate a trigger that checks if the values of the statement are valid. Most triggers are only activated by either INSERT or UPDATE statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriggers are fully supported and can be attached to tables. Triggers can be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE triggers can target specific columns of a table, and triggers can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the trigger\u0027s WHERE clause. Triggers can be attached to views by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, triggers can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL provides an asynchronous messaging system that is accessed through the NOTIFY, LISTEN and UNLISTEN commands. A session can issue a NOTIFY command, along with the user-specified channel and an optional payload, to mark a particular event occurring. Other sessions are able to detect these events by issuing a LISTEN command, which can listen to a particular channel. This functionality can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as letting other sessions know when a table has updated or for separate applications to detect when a particular action has been performed. Such a system prevents the need for continuous polling by applications to see if anything has yet changed, and reducing unnecessary overhead. Notifications are fully transactional, in that messages are not sent until the transaction they were sent from is committed. This eliminates the problem of messages being sent for an action being performed which is then rolled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany connectors for PostgreSQL provide support for this notification system (including libpq, JDBC, Npgsql, psycopg and node.js) so it can be used by external applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL can act as an effective, persistent \"pub/sub\" server or job server by combining LISTEN with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED.[64][65][66]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRules allow the \"query tree\" of an incoming query to be rewritten; they are an, automatically invoked, macro language for SQL. \"Query Re-Write Rules\" are attached to a table/class and \"Re-Write\" the incoming DML (select, insert, update, and/or delete) into one or more queries that either replace the original DML statement or execute in addition to it. Query Re-Write occurs after DML statement parsing and before query planning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe functionality rules provide was, in almost every way, later duplicated with the introduction of newer types of triggers. The use of triggers is usually preferred over rules as it is easier to reason about trigger behavior and interactions than when equivalent rules are used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL server is process-based (not threaded), and uses one operating system process per database session. Multiple sessions are automatically spread across all available CPUs by the operating system. Many types of queries can also be parallelized across multiple background worker processes, taking advantage of multiple CPUs or cores.[73] Client applications can use threads and create multiple database connections from each thread.[74]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL manages its internal security on a per-role basis. A role is generally regarded to be a user (a role that can log in), or a group (a role of which other roles are members). Permissions can be granted or revoked on any object down to the column level, and can allow or prevent the visibility/creation/alteration/deletion of objects at the database, schema, table, and row levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL\u0027s SECURITY LABEL feature (extension to SQL standards), allows for additional security; with a bundled loadable module that supports label-based mandatory access control (MAC) based on Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) security policy.[75][76]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL natively supports a broad number of external authentication mechanisms, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe GSSAPI, SSPI, Kerberos, peer, ident and certificate methods can also use a specified \"map\" file that lists which users matched by that authentication system are allowed to connect as a specific database user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese methods are specified in the cluster\u0027s host-based authentication configuration file (pg_hba.conf), which determines what connections are allowed. This allows control over which user can connect to which database, where they can connect from (IP address, IP address range, domain socket), which authentication system will be enforced, and whether the connection must use Transport Layer Security (TLS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL claims high, but not complete, conformance with the latest SQL standard (\"as of the version 15 release in October 2022, PostgreSQL conforms to at least 170 of the 179 mandatory features for SQL:2016 Core conformance\", and no other databases fully conformed to it[78]). One exception is the handling of unquoted identifiers like table or column names. In PostgreSQL they are folded, internally, to lower case characters[79] whereas the standard says that unquoted identifiers should be folded to upper case. Thus, Foo should be equivalent to FOO not foo according to the standard. Other shortcomings concern the absence of temporal tables allowing automatic logging of row versions during transactions with the possibility of browsing in time (FOR SYSTEM TIME predicate),[citation needed] although relatively SQL compliant third-party extensions are available.[15]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany informal performance studies of PostgreSQL have been done.[80] Performance improvements aimed at improving scalability began heavily with version 8.1. Simple benchmarks between version 8.0 and version 8.4 showed that the latter was more than ten times faster on read-only workloads and at least 7.5 times faster on both read and write workloads.[81]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first industry-standard and peer-validated benchmark was completed in June 2007, using the Sun Java System Application Server (proprietary version of GlassFish) 9.0 Platform Edition, UltraSPARC T1-based Sun Fire server and PostgreSQL 8.2.[82] This result of 778.14 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard compares favourably with the 874 JOPS@Standard with Oracle 10 on an Itanium-based HP-UX system.[80]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn August 2007, Sun submitted an improved benchmark score of 813.73 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard. With the system under test at a reduced price, the price/performance improved from $84.98/JOPS to $70.57/JOPS.[83]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe default configuration of PostgreSQL uses only a small amount of dedicated memory for performance-critical purposes such as caching database blocks and sorting. This limitation is primarily because older operating systems required kernel changes to allow allocating large blocks of shared memory.[84] PostgreSQL.org provides advice on basic recommended performance practice in a wiki.[85]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn April 2012, Robert Haas of EnterpriseDB demonstrated PostgreSQL 9.2\u0027s linear CPU scalability using a server with 64 cores.[86]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatloob Khushi performed benchmarking between PostgreSQL 9.0 and MySQL 5.6.15 for their ability to process genomic data. In his performance analysis he found that PostgreSQL extracts overlapping genomic regions eight times faster than MySQL using two datasets of 80,000 each forming random human DNA regions. Insertion and data uploads in PostgreSQL were also better, although general searching ability of both databases was almost equivalent.[87]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL is available for the following operating systems: Linux (all recent distributions), 64-bit ARM and x86-64 installers available and tested for macOS (OS X)[88] version 10.12 and newer, Windows (with installers available and tested for 64-bit Windows Server 2019 and 2016; some older PostgreSQL versions were tested back to Windows 2012 R2[89]), FreeBSD, OpenBSD,[90] NetBSD, and these without official (though unofficial likely available) binary executables, Solaris,[91] AIX, and HP-UX.[92] Most other (modern) Unix-like systems do also work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePostgreSQL can be expected to work on any of the following instruction set architectures (and operating systems): 64-bit x86-64 and 32-bit x86 on Windows XP (or later) and other operating systems; these are supported on other than Windows: 64-bit ARM[93] and the older 32-bit ARM, including older such as ARMv6 in Raspberry Pi[94]), z/Architecture, S/390, PowerPC (incl. 64-bit Power ISA), SPARC (also 64-bit), IA-64 Itanium (HP-UX), MIPS and PA-RISC. It was also known to work on some other platforms (while not been tested on for years, i.e. for latest versions).[95]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen source front-ends and tools for administering PostgreSQL include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA number of companies offer proprietary tools for PostgreSQL. They often consist of a universal core that is adapted for various specific database products. These tools mostly share the administration features with the open source tools but offer improvements in data modeling, importing, exporting or reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotable organizations and products that use PostgreSQL as the primary database include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome notable vendors offer PostgreSQL as software as a service:\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/tech-general/articles/what-is-assembly-language/","html":""},{"url":"https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/Go-programming-language","html":"\u003cp\u003eGo, also called Golang or Go language, is an Open Source programming language that Google developed.

In this tutorial, we build a tic-tac-toe game in React. You might be tempted to skip it because youâre not into building games â but give it a chance. The techniques youâll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you prefer to learn concepts step by step, our guide to main concepts is the best place to start. Every next chapter in it builds on the knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so you wonât miss anything as you go along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany React users credit reading Thinking in React as the moment React finally âclickedâ for them.

It is the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network.[2][3][4] It was created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky.[5][6] It features questions and answers on certain computer programming topics.[7][8][9] It was created to be a more open alternative to earlier question and answer websites such as Experts-Exchange. Stack Overflow was sold to Prosus, a Netherlands-based consumer internet conglomerate, on 2 June 2021 for $1.8 billion.[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down similar to Reddit and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki.[11] Users of Stack Overflow can earn reputation points and \"badges\"; for example, a person is awarded 10 reputation points for receiving an \"up\" vote on a question or an answer to a question,[12] and can receive badges for their valued contributions,[13] which represents a gamification of the traditional Q\u0026A website. Users unlock new privileges with an increase in reputation like the ability to vote, comment, and even edit other people\u0027s posts.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of March 2024[update] Stack Overflow has over 23 million registered users,[15] and has received over 24 million questions and 35 million answers.[16] The site and similar programming question and answer sites have globally mostly replaced programming books for day-to-day programming reference in the 2000s, and today are an important part of computer programming.[17] Based on the type of tags assigned to questions, the top eight most discussed topics on the site are: JavaScript, Java, C#, PHP, Android, Python, jQuery, and HTML.[18]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe website was created by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky in 2008.[5] The name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of Coding Horror, Atwood\u0027s programming blog.[19] On 31 July 2008, Jeff Atwood sent out invitations encouraging his subscribers to take part in the private beta of the new website, limiting its use to those willing to test out the new software. On 15 September 2008 it was announced that the public beta version was in session and that the general public was now able to use it to seek assistance on programming related issues. The design of the Stack Overflow logo was decided by a voting process.[20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn 3 May 2010, it was announced that Stack Overflow had raised $6 million in venture capital from a group of investors led by Union Square Ventures.[21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, Stack Overflow named Prashanth Chandrasekar as its chief executive officer and Teresa Dietrich as its chief product officer.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2021, Prosus, a Netherlands-based subsidiary of South African media company Naspers, announced a deal to acquire Stack Overflow for $1.8 billion.[23]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn early May 2019, an update was deployed to Stack Overflow\u0027s development version. It contained a bug which allowed an attacker to grant themselves privileges in accessing the production version of the site. Stack Overflow published on their blog that approximately 184 public network users were affected by this breach, which \"could have returned IP address, names, or emails\".[24][25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn mid-2023, Stack Exchange made several changes regarding its policies around content generated by artificial intelligence which resulted in a strike of a portion of its volunteer moderators. The protest centered around a policy posted to moderators on May 29 stating that the use of AI-detection tools were not permitted to be used as part of moderation. In a statement, Stack Exchange confirmed that 11% of moderators had ceased content moderation in response to this policy.[26] This would grow to more than 23% of all moderators on the network by June 22, including more than 70% of all Stack Overflow moderators.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strike began with a post to Meta Stack Exchange, which raised concerns regarding the quality and accuracy of AI-generated content, and the lack of transparency from Stack Exchange surrounding this policy change.[28] Moderators also stated that the version of the policy released to the public differed from the version they had received on the moderator-only forum, notably in that the public version did not include language requiring that moderators stop restricting all AI content.[29]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStack Overflow only accepts questions about programming that are tightly focused on a specific problem. Questions of a broader natureâor those inviting answers that are inherently a matter of opinionâare usually rejected by the site\u0027s users, and marked as closed. The sister site softwareengineering.stackexchange.com is intended to be a venue for broader queries, e.g. general questions about software development.[31]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing questions is a main differentiation from other Q\u0026A sites like Yahoo! Answers and a way to prevent low quality questions. The mechanism was overhauled in 2013; questions edited after being put \"on hold\" now appear in a review queue.[32] Jeff Atwood stated in 2010 that duplicate questions are not seen as a problem but rather they constitute an advantage if such additional questions drive extra traffic to the site by multiplying relevant keyword hits in search engines.[33]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll user-generated content is licensed under Creative Commons Attribute-ShareAlike license, version 2.5, 3.0, or 4.0 depending on the date the content was contributed.[34]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA 2013 study has found that 75% of users only ask one question, 65% only answer one question, and only 8% of users answer more than 5 questions.[35] To empower a wider group of users to ask questions and then answer, Stack Overflow created a mentorship program resulting in users having a 50% increase in score on average.[36] As of 2011, 92% of the questions were answered, in a median time of 11 minutes.[37]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of August 2012[update], 443,000 of the 1.3 million registered users had answered at least one question, and of those, approximately 6,000 (0.46% of the total user count) had earned a reputation score greater than 5000.[38] Reputation can be gained fastest by answering questions related to tags with lower expertise density, doing so promptly (in particular being the first one to answer a question), being active during off-peak hours, and contributing to diverse areas.[38]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStack Overflow is written in C# using the ASP.NET MVC (ModelâViewâController) framework, and Microsoft SQL Server for the database[39] and the Dapper object-relational mapper used for data access.[40] Unregistered users have access to most of the site\u0027s functionality, while users who sign in can gain access to more functionality, such as asking or answering a question, establishing a profile and being able to earn reputation to allow functionality like editing questions and answers without peer review or voting to close a question.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStack Overflow won the 2020 Webby People\u0027s Voice Award for Community in the category Web.[42]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe site\u0027s culture has been criticized for being unfriendly, especially in the context of gender differences in participation and beginners learning computer science.[43] A 2023 study concluded that the website\u0027s neophytes were met with significant difficulties in obtaining help from other users in posts started by the former; an analysis from a sample of 968 posts showed that 49% faced evident hurdles such as being closed, being marked as duplicate, receiving no response, receiving no mention as to why their posts are being negatively scored, or simply being negatively scored.[44]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA study from the University of Maryland found that Android developers that used only Stack Overflow as their programming resource tended to write less secure code than those who used only the official Android developer documentation from Google, while developers using only the official Android documentation tended to write significantly less functional code than those who used only Stack Overflow.[45]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets","html":""},{"url":"https://www.r-project.org/about.html#:~:text\u003dR%20is%20a%20language%20and,by%20John%20Chambers%20and%20colleagues.","html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Home]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRAN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

Containerization allows our development teams to move fast, deploy software efficiently, and operate at an unprecedented scale. Weâve learned a lot about running containerized workloads and weâve shared this knowledge with the community along the way: from the early days of contributing cgroups to the Linux kernel, to taking designs from our internal tools and open sourcing them as the Kubernetes project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers are lightweight packages of your application code together with dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and libraries required to run your software services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers make it easy to share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources at the operating systems level and offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainerization provides a clear separation of responsibility, as developers focus on application logic and dependencies, while IT operations teams can focus on deployment and management instead of application details such as specific software versions and configurations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers can run virtually anywhere, greatly easing development and deployment: on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems; on virtual machines or on physical servers; on a developerâs machine or in data centers on-premises; and of course, in the public cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers virtualize CPU, memory, storage, and network resources at the operating system level, providing developers with a view of the OS logically isolated from other applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might already be familiar with VMs: a guest operating system such as Linux or Windows runs on top of a host operating system with access to the underlying hardware.

Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL). MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe American software company 10gen began developing MongoDB in 2007 as a component of a planned platform-as-a-service product. In 2009, the company shifted to an open-source development model and began offering commercial support and other services. In 2013, 10gen changed its name to MongoDB Inc.[5]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn October 20, 2017, MongoDB became a publicly traded company, listed on NASDAQ as MDB with an IPO price of $24 per share.[6]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn November 8, 2018 with the stable release 4.0.4, the software\u0027s license changed from AGPL 3.0 to SSPL.[7][8]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn October 30, 2019, MongoDB teamed with Alibaba Cloud to offer Alibaba Cloud customers a MongoDB-as-a-service solution. Customers can use the managed offering from Alibaba\u0027s global data centers.[9]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB supports field, range query and regular-expression searches.[33] Queries can return specific fields of documents and also include user-defined JavaScript functions. Queries can also be configured to return a random sample of results of a given size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFields in a MongoDB document can be indexed with primary and secondary indices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB provides high availability with replica sets.[34] A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data. Each replica-set member may act in the role of primary or secondary replica at any time. All writes and reads are done on the primary replica by default. Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary using built-in replication. When a primary replica fails, the replica set automatically conducts an election process to determine which secondary should become the primary. Secondaries can optionally serve read operations, but that data is only eventually consistent by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the replicated MongoDB deployment only has a single secondary member, a separate daemon called an arbiter must be added to the set. It has the single responsibility of resolving the election of the new primary.[35] As a consequence, an ideal distributed MongoDB deployment requires at least three separate servers, even in the case of just one primary and one secondary.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB scales horizontally using sharding.[36] The user chooses a shard key, which determines how the data in a collection will be distributed. The data is split into ranges (based on the shard key) and distributed across multiple shards, which are masters with one or more replicas. Alternatively, the shard key can be hashed to map to a shardâenabling an even data distribution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB can run over multiple servers, balancing the load or duplicating data to keep the system functional in case of hardware failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB can be used as a file system, called GridFS, with load-balancing and data-replication features over multiple machines for storing files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis function, called a grid file system,[37] is included with MongoDB drivers. MongoDB exposes functions for file manipulation and content to developers. GridFS can be accessed using the mongofiles utility or plugins for Nginx[38] and lighttpd.[39] GridFS divides a file into parts, or chunks, and stores each of those chunks as a separate document.[40]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the aggregation pipeline, the map-reduce function and single-purpose aggregation methods.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMap-reduce can be used for batch processing of data and aggregation operations. However, according to MongoDB\u0027s documentation, the aggregation pipeline provides better performance for most aggregation operations.[42]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aggregation framework enables users to obtain results similar to those returned by queries that include the SQL GROUP BY clause. Aggregation operators can be strung together to form a pipeline, analogous to Unix pipes.

This type of collection maintains insertion order and, once the specified size has been reached, behaves like a circular queue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB supports multi-document ACID transactions since the 4.0 release in June 2018.[43]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MongoDB Community Edition is free and available for Windows, Linux and macOS.[44]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB Enterprise Server is the commercial edition of MongoDB and is available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise Advanced subscription.[45]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB is also available as an on-demand, fully managed service. MongoDB Atlas runs on AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.[46]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 10, 2022, MongoDB warned its users in Russia and Belarus that their data stored on the MongoDB Atlas platform will be destroyed as a result of American sanctions related to the Russo-Ukrainian War.[47]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB has official drivers for major programming languages and development environments.[48] There are also a large number of unofficial or community-supported drivers for other programming languages and frameworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary interface to the database has been the mongo shell. Since MongoDB 3.2, MongoDB Compass is introduced as the native GUI. There are products and third-party projects that offer user interfaces for administration and data viewing.[49]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of October 2018, MongoDB is released under the Server Side Public License (SSPL), a non-free license developed by the project. It replaces the GNU Affero General Public License, and is nearly identical to the GNU General Public License version 3, but requires that those making the software publicly available as part of a \"service\" must make the service\u0027s entire source code (insofar that a user would be able to recreate the service themselves) available under this license. By contrast, the AGPL only requires the source code of the licensed software to be provided to users when the software is conveyed over a network.[50][51] The SSPL was submitted for certification to the Open Source Initiative but later withdrawn.[52] In January 2021, the Open Source Initiative stated that SSPL is not an open source license.[53] The language drivers are available under an Apache License. In addition, MongoDB Inc. offers proprietary licenses for MongoDB. The last versions licensed as AGPL version 3 are 4.0.3 (stable) and 4.1.4.[54]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB has been removed from the Debian, Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions because of the licensing change. Fedora determined that the SSPL version 1 is not a free software license because it is \"intentionally crafted to be aggressively discriminatory\" towards commercial users.[55][56]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of MongoDB\u0027s default security configuration, which allows any user full access to the database, data from tens of thousands of MongoDB installations has been stolen. Furthermore, many MongoDB servers have been held for ransom.[57][58] In September 2017, Davi Ottenheimer head of product security at MongoDB, proclaimed that measures had been taken to defend against these risks.[59]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the MongoDB 2.6 release onward, the binaries for the official MongoDB RPM and DEB packages bind to localhost by default. From MongoDB 3.6, this default behavior was extended to all MongoDB packages across all platforms. As a result, all networked connections to the database are denied unless explicitly configured by an administrator.[60]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn some failure scenarios in which an application can access two distinct MongoDB processes that cannot access each other, it is possible for MongoDB to return stale reads. It is also possible for MongoDB to roll back writes that have been acknowledged.[61] The issue was addressed in version 3.4.0, released in November 2016,[62] and applied to earlier releases from v3.2.12 onward.[63]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore version 2.2, locks were implemented on a per-server-process basis. With version 2.2, locks were implemented at the database level.[64] Beginning with version 3.0,[65] pluggable storage engines are available, and each storage engine may implement locks differently.[65] With MongoDB 3.0, locks are implemented at the collection level for the MMAPv1 storage engine,[66] while the WiredTiger storage engine uses an optimistic concurrency protocol that effectively provides document-level locking.[67] Even with versions prior to 3.0, one approach to increase concurrency is to use sharding.[68] In some situations, reads and writes will yield their locks. If MongoDB predicts that a page is unlikely to be in memory, operations will yield their lock while the pages load. The use of lock yielding expanded greatly in version 2.2.[69]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil version 3.3.11, MongoDB could not perform collation-based sorting and was limited to bytewise comparison via memcmp, which would not provide correct ordering for many non-English languages when used with a Unicode encoding. The issue was fixed on August 23, 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to MongoDB 4.0, queries against an index were not atomic. Documents that were updated while queries was running could be missed.[70] The introduction of the snapshot read concern in MongoDB 4.0 eliminated this risk.[71]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB claimed that version 3.6.4 had passed \"the industry\u0027s toughest data safety, correctness, and consistency tests\" by Jepsen, and that \"MongoDB offers among the strongest data consistency, correctness, and safety guarantees of any database available today.\"[72] Jepsen, which describes itself as a \"distributed systems safety research company,\" disputed both claims on Twitter, saying, \"In that report, MongoDB lost data and violated causal by default.\" In its May 2020 report on MongoDB version 4.2.6, Jepsen wrote that MongoDB had only mentioned tests that version 3.6.4 had passed, and that version had 4.2.6 introduced more problems.[73] Jepsen\u0027s test summary reads in part:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJepsen evaluated MongoDB version 4.2.6, and found that even at the strongest levels of read and write concern, it failed to preserve snapshot isolation. Instead, Jepsen observed read skew, cyclic information flow, duplicate writes, and internal consistency violations. Weak defaults meant that transactions could lose writes and allow dirty reads, even downgrading requested safety levels at the database and collection level. Moreover, the snapshot read concern did not guarantee snapshot unless paired with write concern majorityâeven for read-only transactions. These design choices complicate the safe use of MongoDB transactions.[74]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn May 26, Jepsen updated the report to say: \"MongoDB identified a bug in the transaction retry mechanism which they believe was responsible for the anomalies observed in this report; a patch is scheduled for 4.2.8.\"[74] The issue has been patched as of that version, and \"Jepsen criticisms of the default write concerns have also been addressed, with the default write concern now elevated to the majority concern (w:majority) from MongoDB 5.0.\"[75]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB Inc. hosts an annual developer conference that has been called MongoDB World or MongoDB.live.[76]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle","html":"\u003cp\u003eKaggle is a data science competition platform and online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners under Google LLC.

This will save a lot of time and make development much easier and there is also no need to reinvent the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifference between library and framework: Libraries are basically a collection of some reusable classes and function that is combined together for solving a specific problem. Libraries do not bound programmers to use it in a specific way, programmers are in charge of using it as they want according to their requirements. Like jquery, this is a javascript library that makes it easy for DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation also it handles events very efficiently. It includes AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript XML) which can handle the asynchronous task between client and server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, a framework is a collection of tools for creating and developing a project in a standard manner. It tells you to put a specific part of code in a specific place. It makes development very easy because it contains built-in codes for some specific tasks. Like handling routes, performing HTTP requests, or handling data from the backend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePopular Libraries in Javascript:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. React.js: React.js is the most popular and widely used JavaScript library out there these days. It is an open-source library. This is sometimes considered as a framework because there are so many packages available for reacting like handling routes which you can integrate into react.js and can develop any type of application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt follows SPA (Single Page Application) which is referred to as you need not refresh the page Reactjs will automatically render the certain component and inject it into the dom automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. jQuery: jquery is an old javascript library that is used for DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation and handling events like mouse clicks, scrolling, etc. Also, it contains AJAX which handles the Asynchronous part of any application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. D3.js: D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents. It is basically used for data visualization. It takes a certain amount of data and applies it to manipulate the Document object model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Underscore.js: Underscore.js is a lightweight JavaScript library and not a complete framework that was written by Jeremy Ashkenas that provides utility functions for a variety of use cases in our day-to-day common programming tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Lodash: Lodash is a JavaScript library that works on the top of underscore.js. Lodash helps in working with arrays, strings, objects, numbers, etc. It provides us with various inbuilt functions and uses a functional programming approach that makes coding in JavaScript easier to understand because instead of writing repetitive functions, tasks can be accomplished with a single line of code. It also makes it easier to work with objects in javascript if they require a lot of manipulation to be done upon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. Anime.js: Anime.js is a small, lightweight JavaScript library with a simple and small powerful API. It works with the DOM element, CSS, and JavaScript object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7. Chart.js: Chart.js is an open-source JavaScript library on Github that allows you to draw different types of charts by using the HTML5 canvas element. Since it uses canvas, you have to include a polyfill to support older browsers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrameworks available in Javascript:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Angular: Angular is an open-source framework developed by Google. This framework is based on typescript(a superset of javascript) you can say that some strict type checking applies to javascript. It is free and used for cross-platform development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Vue.js: Vue is also an open-source framework for javascript. It is used for building great user Interfaces and single-page applications(SPAâs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Ember.js: Ember.js is an open-source JavaScript framework used for developing large client-side web applications which is based on Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Ember is designed for reducing development time and increasing productivity, it is one of the fastest-growing front-end application frameworks being adopted worldwide. It is currently used on many websites such as Square, Discourse, Groupon, Linked In, Live Nation, Twitch, and Chipotle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Node.js: Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework and itâs not a programming language. Most people are confused and understand itâs a framework or a programming language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. Itâs used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Next.js: Next.js is a React-based framework. It has the power to Develop beautiful Web applications for different platforms like Windows, Linux, and mac. If you have little experience in react and looking forward to knowing more about react ecosystem then you should have knowledge about the Next.js framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. Mocha: Mocha is a testing framework for Javascript running on Node.js. The frameworks make it easier to test asynchronous Javascript concepts in the browser. Mocha is widely used for testing Javascript codes before deploying them onto the server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.r-project.org/","html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Home]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRAN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

In this online course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few examples of questions that we are going to cover in this class are the following: 1. What is a good strategy of resizing a dynamic array? 2. How priority queues are implemented in C++, Java, and Python? 3. How to implement a hash table so that the amortized running time of all operations is O(1) on average? 4. What are good strategies to keep a binary tree balanced? You will also learn how services like Dropbox manage to upload some large files instantly and to save a lot of storage space!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this module, you will learn about the basic data structures used throughout the rest of this course. We start this module by looking in detail at the fundamental building blocks: arrays and linked lists. From there, we build up two important data structures: stacks and queues. Next, we look at trees: examples of how theyâre used in Computer Science, how theyâre implemented, and the various ways they can be traversed. Once youâve completed this module, you will be able to implement any of these data structures, as well as have a solid understanding of the costs of the operations, as well as the tradeoffs involved in using each data structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7 videos 7 readings 1 quiz 1 programming assignment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this module, we discuss Dynamic Arrays: a way of using arrays when it is unknown ahead-of-time how many elements will be needed. Here, we also discuss amortized analysis: a method of determining the amortized cost of an operation over a sequence of operations. Amortized analysis is very often used to analyse performance of algorithms when the straightforward analysis produces unsatisfactory results, but amortized analysis helps to show that the algorithm is actually efficient. It is used both for Dynamic Arrays analysis and will also be used in the end of this course to analyze Splay trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5 videos 1 reading 1 quiz\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe start this module by considering priority queues which are used to efficiently schedule jobs, either in the context of a computer operating system or in real life, to sort huge files, which is the most important building block for any Big Data processing algorithm, and to efficiently compute shortest paths in graphs, which is a topic we will cover in our next course. For this reason, priority queues have built-in implementations in many programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. We will see that these implementations are based on a beautiful idea of storing a complete binary tree in an array that allows to implement all priority queue methods in just few lines of code. We will then switch to disjoint sets data structure that is used, for example, in dynamic graph connectivity and image processing. We will see again how simple and natural ideas lead to an implementation that is both easy to code and very efficient. By completing this module, you will be able to implement both these data structures efficiently from scratch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15 videos 6 readings 3 quizzes 1 programming assignment 1 plugin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this module you will learn about very powerful and widely used technique called hashing. Its applications include implementation of programming languages, file systems, pattern search, distributed key-value storage and many more. You will learn how to implement data structures to store and modify sets of objects and mappings from one type of objects to another one. You will see that naive implementations either consume huge amount of memory or are slow, and then you will learn to implement hash tables that use linear memory and work in O(1) on average! In the end, you will learn how hash functions are used in modern disrtibuted systems and how they are used to optimize storage of services like Dropbox, Google Drive and Yandex Disk!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e20 videos 4 readings 2 quizzes 1 programming assignment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this module we study binary search trees, which are a data structure for doing searches on dynamically changing ordered sets. You will learn about many of the difficulties in accomplishing this task and the ways in which we can overcome them. In order to do this you will need to learn the basic structure of binary search trees, how to insert and delete without destroying this structure, and how to ensure that the tree remains balanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7 videos 2 readings 1 quiz\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this module we continue studying binary search trees.

You\u0027ll need to open a new terminal (command prompt) for the node and npm command-line tools to be on your PATH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo test that you have Node.js installed correctly on your computer, open a new terminal and type node --version and you should see the current Node.js version installed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinux: There are specific Node.js packages available for the various flavors of Linux. See Installing Node.js via package manager to find the Node.js package and installation instructions tailored to your version of Linux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindows Subsystem for Linux: If you are on Windows, WSL is a great way to do Node.js development. You can run Linux distributions on Windows and install Node.js into the Linux environment. When coupled with the WSL extension, you get full VS Code editing and debugging support while running in the context of WSL. To learn more, go to Developing in WSL or try the Working in WSL tutorial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s get started by creating the simplest Node.js application, \"Hello World\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate an empty folder called \"hello\", navigate into and open VS Code:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTip: You can open files or folders directly from the command line. The period \u0027.\u0027 refers to the current folder, therefore VS Code will start and open the Hello folder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the File Explorer toolbar, press the New File button:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand name the file app.js:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy using the .js file extension, VS Code interprets this file as JavaScript and will evaluate the contents with the JavaScript language service. Refer to the VS Code JavaScript language topic to learn more about JavaScript support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate a simple string variable in app.js and send the contents of the string to the console:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that when you typed console. IntelliSense on the console object was automatically presented to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso notice that VS Code knows that msg is a string based on the initialization to \u0027Hello World\u0027. If you type msg. you\u0027ll see IntelliSense showing all of the string functions available on msg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter experimenting with IntelliSense, revert any extra changes from the source code example above and save the file (âS (Windows, Linux Ctrl+S)).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s simple to run app.js with Node.js. From a terminal, just type:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should see \"Hello World\" output to the terminal and then Node.js returns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVS Code has an integrated terminal which you can use to run shell commands. You can run Node.js directly from there and avoid switching out of VS Code while running command-line tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eView \u003e Terminal (â` (Windows, Linux Ctrl+`) with the backtick character) will open the integrated terminal and you can run node app.js there:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this walkthrough, you can use either an external terminal or the VS Code integrated terminal for running the command-line tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned in the introduction, VS Code ships with a debugger for Node.js applications. Let\u0027s try debugging our simple Hello World application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo set a breakpoint in app.js, put the editor cursor on the first line and press F9 or click in the editor left gutter next to the line numbers. A red circle will appear in the gutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start debugging, select the Run and Debug view in the Activity Bar:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can now click Debug toolbar green arrow or press F5 to launch and debug \"Hello World\". Your breakpoint will be hit and you can view and step through the simple application. Notice that VS Code displays a different colored Status Bar to indicate it is in Debug mode and the DEBUG CONSOLE is displayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you\u0027ve seen VS Code in action with \"Hello World\", the next section shows using VS Code with a full-stack Node.js web app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: We\u0027re done with the \"Hello World\" example so navigate out of that folder before you create an Express app. You can delete the \"Hello\" folder if you want as it is not required for the rest of the walkthrough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpress is a very popular application framework for building and running Node.js applications. You can scaffold (create) a new Express application using the Express Generator tool. The Express Generator is shipped as an npm module and installed by using the npm command-line tool npm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTip: To test that you\u0027ve got npm correctly installed on your computer, type npm --help from a terminal and you should see the usage documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstall the Express Generator by running the following from a terminal:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe -g switch installs the Express Generator globally on your machine so you can run it from anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can now scaffold a new Express application called myExpressApp by running:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis creates a new folder called myExpressApp with the contents of your application. The --view pug parameters tell the generator to use the pug template engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo install all of the application\u0027s dependencies (again shipped as npm modules), go to the new folder and execute npm install:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, we should test that our application runs. The generated Express application has a package.json file which includes a start script to run node ./bin/www. This will start the Node.js application running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a terminal in the Express application folder, run:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Node.js web server will start and you can browse to http://localhost:3000 to see the running application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose the browser and from a terminal in the myExpressApp folder, stop the Node.js server by pressing CTRL+C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow launch VS Code:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: If you\u0027ve been using the VS Code integrated terminal to install the Express generator and scaffold the app, you can open the myExpressApp folder from your running VS Code instance with the File \u003e Open Folder command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Node.js and Express documentation does a great job explaining how to build rich applications using the platform and framework. Visual Studio Code will make you more productive in developing these types of applications by providing great code editing and navigation experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen the file app.js and hover over the Node.js global object __dirname. Notice how VS Code understands that __dirname is a string. Even more interesting, you can get full IntelliSense against the Node.js framework. For example, you can require http and get full IntelliSense against the http class as you type in Visual Studio Code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVS Code uses TypeScript type declaration (typings) files (for example node.d.ts) to provide metadata to VS Code about the JavaScript based frameworks you are consuming in your application. Type declaration files are written in TypeScript so they can express the data types of parameters and functions, allowing VS Code to provide a rich IntelliSense experience. Thanks to a feature called Automatic Type Acquisition, you do not have to worry about downloading these type declaration files, VS Code will install them automatically for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also write code that references modules in other files. For example, in app.js we require the ./routes/index module, which exports an Express.Router class. If you bring up IntelliSense on index, you can see the shape of the Router class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will need to create a debugger configuration file launch.json for your Express application. Click on Run and Debug in the Activity Bar (â§âD (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+D)) and then select the create a launch.json file link to create a default launch.json file. Select the Node.js environment by ensuring that the type property in configurations is set to \"node\". When the file is first created, VS Code will look in package.json for a start script and will use that value as the program (which in this case is \"${workspaceFolder}\\\\bin\\\\www) for the Launch Program configuration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSave the new file and make sure Launch Program is selected in the configuration dropdown at the top of the Run and Debug view. Open app.js and set a breakpoint near the top of the file where the Express app object is created by clicking in the gutter to the left of the line number. Press F5 to start debugging the application. VS Code will start the server in a new terminal and hit the breakpoint we set. From there you can inspect variables, create watches, and step through your code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027d like to learn how to deploy your web application, check out the Deploying Applications to Azure tutorials where we show how to run your website in Azure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is much more to explore with Visual Studio Code, please try the following topics:\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-programming-language-introduction/","html":"\u003cp\u003eR is an open-source programming language that is widely used as a statistical software and data analysis tool.

It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language since then.[18] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022[update] according to GitHub.[19] Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.[20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun\u0027s Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of March 2024[update], Java 22 is the latest version. Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 are previous LTS versions still officially supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[21] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[22] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling\u0027s office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[23] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[24]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[25] It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[26] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 â 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[27][28][29] Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[30] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software (FOSS), under the terms of the GPL-2.0-only license. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM\u0027s core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.[31]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun\u0027s vice-president Rich Green said that Sun\u0027s ideal role with regard to Java was as an evangelist.[32] Following Oracle Corporation\u0027s acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009â10, Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency.[33] This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see the Android section).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.[34]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers.[36]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java, due to unresolved security issues in older versions.[37]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of September 2023[update], Java 8, 11, 17 and 21 are supported as Long-Term Support (LTS) versions.[38]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors such as Adoptium continue to offer free builds of OpenJDK\u0027s Long-Term Support (LTS) versions. These builds may include additional security patches and bug fixes.[39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMajor release versions of Java, along with their release dates:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe classes in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups called packages. Each package contains a set of related interfaces, classes, subpackages and exceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun also provided an edition called Personal Java that has been superseded by later, standards-based Java ME configuration-profile pairings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End-users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their device for standalone Java applications or a web browser for Java applets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStandard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java\u0027s Hotspot compiler is actually two compilers in one; and with GraalVM (included in e.g. Java 11, but removed as of Java 16) allowing tiered compilation.[48] Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine (JVM), which translates the Java bytecode into the platform\u0027s machine language.[49]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrograms written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++.[50][51] However, Java programs\u0027 execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of just-in-time compilation in 1997/1998 for Java 1.1,[52] the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.), and optimizations in the Java virtual machine, such as HotSpot becoming Sun\u0027s default JVM in 2000. With Java 1.5, the performance was improved with the addition of the java.util.concurrent package, including lock-free implementations of the ConcurrentMaps and other multi-core collections, and it was improved further with Java 1.6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome platforms offer direct hardware support for Java; there are micro controllers that can run Java bytecode in hardware instead of a software Java virtual machine,[53] and some ARM-based processors could have hardware support for executing Java bytecode through their Jazelle option, though support has mostly been dropped in current implementations of ARM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle. The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use. Once no references to an object remain, the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector. Something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer\u0027s code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use.[54] If methods for a non-existent object are called, a null pointer exception is thrown.[55][56]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the ideas behind Java\u0027s automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management. In some languages, memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the stack or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the heap. In the latter case, the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer. If the program does not deallocate an object, a memory leak occurs.[54] If the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated, the result is undefined and difficult to predict, and the program is likely to become unstable or crash. This can be partially remedied by the use of smart pointers, but these add overhead and complexity. Garbage collection does not prevent logical memory leaks, i.e. those where the memory is still referenced but never used.[54]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarbage collection may happen at any time. Ideally, it will occur when a program is idle. It is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object; this can cause a program to stall momentarily. Explicit memory management is not possible in Java.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava does not support C/C++ style pointer arithmetic, where object addresses can be arithmetically manipulated (e.g. by adding or subtracting an offset). This allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java\u0027s primitive data types are either stored directly in fields (for objects) or on the stack (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for non-primitive data types (but see escape analysis). This was a conscious decision by Java\u0027s designers for performance reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava contains multiple types of garbage collectors. Since Java 9, HotSpot uses the Garbage First Garbage Collector (G1GC) as the default.[57] However, there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap. For most applications in Java, G1GC is sufficient. Previously, the Parallel Garbage Collector was used in Java 8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving solved the memory management problem does not relieve the programmer of the burden of handling properly other kinds of resources, like network or database connections, file handles, etc., especially in the presence of exceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language.[17] All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading[58] or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces.[59]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the Javadoc commenting style opened with /** and closed with */. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create documentation for the program and can be read by some integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava applets are programs embedded in other applications, typically in a Web page displayed in a web browser. The Java applet API is now deprecated since Java 9 in 2017.[60][61]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava servlet technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server and for accessing existing business systems. Servlets are server-side Java EE components that generate responses to requests from clients. Most of the time, this means generating HTML pages in response to HTTP requests, although there are a number of other standard servlet classes available, for example for WebSocket communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Java servlet API has to some extent been superseded (but still used under the hood) by two standard Java technologies for web services:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical implementations of these APIs on Application Servers or Servlet Containers use a standard servlet for handling all interactions with the HTTP requests and responses that delegate to the web service methods for the actual business logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaServer Pages (JSP) are server-side Java EE components that generate responses, typically HTML pages, to HTTP requests from clients. JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special delimiters \u003c% and %\u003e. A JSP is compiled to a Java servlet, a Java application in its own right, the first time it is accessed. After that, the generated servlet creates the response.[62]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwing is a graphical user interface library for the Java SE platform. It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the pluggable look and feel system of Swing. Clones of Windows, GTK+, and Motif are supplied by Sun. Apple also provides an Aqua look and feel for macOS. Where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native GUI widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms.[63]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich web applications that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE, but since JDK 11 JavaFX has not been in the core JDK and instead in a separate module.[64] JavaFX has support for desktop computers and web browsers on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. JavaFX does not have support for native OS look and feels.[65]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2004, generics were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0. Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually Object, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class. Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code. In addition to enabling more efficient code, certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, by issuing compile-time errors. If Java prevented all runtime type errors (ClassCastExceptions) from occurring, it would be type safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, the type system of Java was proven unsound in that it is possible to use generics to construct classes and methods that allow assignment of an instance one class to a variable of another unrelated class. Such code is accepted by the compiler, but fails at run time with a class cast exception.[66]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCriticisms directed at Java include the implementation of generics,[67] speed,[50] the handling of unsigned numbers,[68] the implementation of floating-point arithmetic,[69] and a history of security vulnerabilities in the primary Java VM implementation HotSpot.[70]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Java Class Library is the standard library, developed to support application development in Java. It is controlled by Oracle in cooperation with others through the Java Community Process program.[71] Companies or individuals participating in this process can influence the design and development of the APIs. This process has been a subject of controversy during the 2010s.[72] The class library contains features such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavadoc is a comprehensive documentation system, created by Sun Microsystems. It provides developers with an organized system for documenting their code. Javadoc comments have an extra asterisk at the beginning, i.e. the delimiters are /** and */, whereas the normal multi-line comments in Java are delimited by /* and */, and single-line comments start with //.[77]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOracle Corporation owns the official implementation of the Java SE platform, due to its acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 27, 2010. This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris. Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by Ecma International, ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organizations, the Oracle implementation is the de facto standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end users, and the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger. Oracle has also released GraalVM, a high performance Java dynamic compiler and interpreter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpenJDK is another Java SE implementation that is licensed under the GNU GPL. The implementation started when Sun began releasing the Java source code under the GPL. As of Java SE 7, OpenJDK is the official Java reference implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal of Java is to make all implementations of Java compatible. Historically, Sun\u0027s trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be compatible. This resulted in a legal dispute with Microsoft after Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support Java remote method invocation (RMI) or Java Native Interface (JNI) and had added platform-specific features of their own. Sun sued in 1997, and, in 2001, won a settlement of US$20 million, as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from Sun.[78] As a result, Microsoft no longer ships Java with Windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlatform-independent Java is essential to Java EE, and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation. This environment enables portable server-side applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Java programming language requires the presence of a software platform in order for compiled programs to be executed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOracle supplies the Java platform for use with Java. The Android SDK is an alternative software platform, used primarily for developing Android applications with its own GUI system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Java language is a key pillar in Android, an open source mobile operating system. Although Android, built on the Linux kernel, is written largely in C, the Android SDK uses the Java language as the basis for Android applications but does not use any of its standard GUI, SE, ME or other established Java standards.[79] The bytecode language supported by the Android SDK is incompatible with Java bytecode and runs on its own virtual machine, optimized for low-memory devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Depending on the Android version, the bytecode is either interpreted by the Dalvik virtual machine or compiled into native code by the Android Runtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndroid does not provide the full Java SE standard library, although the Android SDK does include an independent implementation of a large subset of it. It supports Java 6 and some Java 7 features, offering an implementation compatible with the standard library (Apache Harmony).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of Java-related technology in Android led to a legal dispute between Oracle and Google. On May 7, 2012, a San Francisco jury found that if APIs could be copyrighted, then Google had infringed Oracle\u0027s copyrights by the use of Java in Android devices.[80] District Judge William Alsup ruled on May 31, 2012, that APIs cannot be copyrighted,[81] but this was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in May 2014.[82] On May 26, 2016, the district court decided in favor of Google, ruling the copyright infringement of the Java API in Android constitutes fair use.[83] In March 2018, this ruling was overturned by the Appeals Court, which sent down the case of determining the damages to federal court in San Francisco.[84] Google filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States in January 2019 to challenge the two rulings that were made by the Appeals Court in Oracle\u0027s favor.[85] On April 5, 2021, the Court ruled 6â2 in Google\u0027s favor, that its use of Java APIs should be considered fair use. However, the court refused to rule on the copyrightability of APIs, choosing instead to determine their ruling by considering Java\u0027s API copyrightable \"purely for argument\u0027s sake.\"[86]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_oop.asp","html":"\u003cp\u003eW3Schools offers a wide range of services and products for beginners and professionals, helping millions of people everyday to learn and master new skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoy our free tutorials like millions of other internet users since 1999\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplore our selection of references covering all popular coding languages\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate your own website with W3Schools Spaces - no setup required\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTest your skills with different exercises\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTest yourself with multiple choice questions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocument your knowledge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate a free W3Schools Account to Improve Your Learning Experience\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrack your learning progress at W3Schools and collect rewards\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecome a PLUS user and unlock powerful features (ad-free, hosting, support,..)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot sure where you want to start?

C# encompasses static typing,[16]:â4â strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic,[16]:â22â object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619[c]) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of November 2023,[update] the most recent stable version of the language is C# 12.0, which was released in 2023 in .NET 8.0.[18][19]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ecma standard lists these design goals for C#:[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler system named Simple Managed C (SMC).[22][23] In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for \"C-like Object Oriented Language\".[24] Microsoft had considered keeping the name \"Cool\" as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHejlsberg is C#\u0027s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft, and was previously involved with the design of Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi), and Visual J++. In interviews and technical papers, he has stated that flaws[25] in most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C# language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Gosling, who created the Java programming language in 1994, and Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the originator of Java, called C# an \"imitation\" of Java; Gosling further said that \"[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted.\"[26][27] In July 2000, Hejlsberg said that C# is \"not a Java clone\" and is \"much closer to C++\" in its design.[28]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming two quite different languages. One of the first major departures came with the addition of generics to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# makes use of reification to provide \"first-class\" generic objects that can be used like any other class, with code generation performed at class-load time.[29] Furthermore, C# has added several major features to accommodate functional-style programming, culminating in the LINQ extensions released with C# 3.0 and its supporting framework of lambda expressions, extension methods, and anonymous types.[30] These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques, such as closures, when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers reduce the amount of boilerplate code that is included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability.[31]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# used to have a mascot called Andy (named after Anders Hejlsberg). It was retired on January 29, 2004.[32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# was originally submitted to the ISO/IEC JTC 1 subcommittee SC 22 for review,[33] under ISO/IEC 23270:2003,[34] was withdrawn and was then approved under ISO/IEC 23270:2006.[35] The 23270:2006 is withdrawn under 23270:2018 and approved with this version.[36]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft first used the name C# in 1988 for a variant of the C language designed for incremental compilation.[37] That project was not completed, and the name was later reused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name \"C sharp\" was inspired by the musical notation whereby a sharp symbol indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch.[38] This is similar to the language name of C++, where \"++\" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1 after being evaluated. The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four \"+\" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++.[39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to technical limitations of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.) and the fact that the sharp symbol ( U+266F â¯ MUSIC SHARP SIGN ( \u0026sharp;)) is not present on most keyboard layouts, the number sign ( U+0023 # NUMBER SIGN ( \u0026num;)) was chosen to approximate the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language.[40] This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification.[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"sharp\" suffix has been used by a number of other .NET languages that are variants of existing languages, including J# (a .NET language also designed by Microsoft that is derived from Java 1.1), A# (from Ada), and the functional programming language F#.[41] The original implementation of Eiffel for .NET was called Eiffel#,[42] a name retired since the full Eiffel language is now supported. The suffix has also been used for libraries, such as Gtk# (a .NET wrapper for GTK and other GNOME libraries) and Cocoa# (a wrapper for Cocoa).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core syntax of the C# language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C, C++ and Java, particularly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome notable features of C# that distinguish it from C, C++, and Java where noted, are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy design, C# is the programming language that most directly reflects the underlying Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).[68] Most of its intrinsic types correspond to value-types implemented by the CLI framework. However, the language specification does not state the code generation requirements of the compiler: that is, it does not state that a C# compiler must target a Common Language Runtime, or generate Common Intermediate Language (CIL), or generate any other specific format. Some C# compilers can also generate machine code like traditional compilers of C++ or Fortran.[69][70]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# supports strongly, implicitly typed variable declarations with the keyword var,[16]:â470â and implicitly typed arrays with the keyword new[] followed by a collection initializer.[16]:â80â[20]:â58â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts type system is split into two families: Value types, like the built-in numeric types and user-defined structs, which are automatically handed over as copies when used as parameters, and reference types, including arrays, instances of classes, and strings, which only hand over a pointer to the respective object. Due to their special handling of the equality operator, strings will nevertheless behave as if they were values, for all practical purposes. You can even use them as case labels. Where necessary, value types will be boxed automatically.[71]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# supports a strict Boolean data type, bool. Statements that take conditions, such as while and if, require an expression of a type that implements the true operator, such as the Boolean type. While C++ also has a Boolean type, it can be freely converted to and from integers, and expressions such as if (a) require only that a is convertible to bool, allowing a to be an int, or a pointer. C# disallows this \"integer meaning true or false\" approach, on the grounds that forcing programmers to use expressions that return exactly bool can prevent certain types of programming mistakes such as if (a \u003d b) (use of assignment \u003d instead of equality \u003d\u003d).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# is more type safe than C++. The only implicit conversions by default are those that are considered safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during JIT, and, in some cases, at runtime. No implicit conversions occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ copy constructors and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# has explicit support for covariance and contravariance in generic types,[16]:â144â[20]:â23â unlike C++ which has some degree of support for contravariance simply through the semantics of return types on virtual methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnumeration members are placed in their own scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C# language does not allow for global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes. Static members of public classes can substitute for global variables and functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal variables cannot shadow variables of the enclosing block, unlike C and C++.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMetaprogramming can be achieved in several ways:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA method in C# is a member of a class that can be invoked as a function (a sequence of instructions), rather than the mere value-holding capability of a field (i.e. class or instance variable).[76] As in other syntactically similar languages, such as C++ and ANSI C, the signature of a method is a declaration comprising in order: any optional accessibility keywords (such as private), the explicit specification of its return type (such as int, or the keyword void if no value is returned), the name of the method, and finally, a parenthesized sequence of comma-separated parameter specifications, each consisting of a parameter\u0027s type, its formal name and optionally, a default value to be used whenever none is provided. Different from most other languages, call-by-reference parameters have to be marked both at the function definition and at the calling site, and you can choose between ref and out, the latter allowing handing over an uninitialized variable which will have a definite value on return.[77] Additionally, you can specify a variable-sized argument list by applying the params keyword to the last parameter.[78] Certain specific kinds of methods, such as those that simply get or set a field\u0027s value by returning or assigning it, do not require an explicitly stated full signature, but in the general case, the definition of a class includes the full signature declaration of its methods.[79]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike C++, and unlike Java, C# programmers must use the scope modifier keyword virtual to allow methods to be overridden by subclasses. Unlike C++, you have to explicitly specify the keyword override when doing so.[80] This is supposed to avoid confusion between overriding and newly overloading a function (i.e. hiding the former implementation). To do the latter, you have to specify the new keyword.[81]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtension methods in C# allow programmers to use static methods as if they were methods from a class\u0027s method table, allowing programmers to virtually add instance methods to a class that they feel should exist on that kind of objects (and instances of the respective derived classes).[16]:â103â105â[20]:â202â203â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe type dynamic allows for run-time method binding, allowing for JavaScript-like method calls and run-time object composition.[16]:â114â118â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# has support for strongly-typed function pointers via the keyword delegate. Like the Qt framework\u0027s pseudo-C++ signal and slot, C# has semantics specifically surrounding publish-subscribe style events, though C# uses delegates to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# offers Java-like synchronized method calls, via the attribute [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)], and has support for mutually-exclusive locks via the keyword lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# supports classes with properties. The properties can be simple accessor functions with a backing field, or implement arbitrary getter and setter functions. A property is read-only if there\u0027s no setter. Like with fields, there can be class and instance properties. The underlying methods can be virtual or abstract like any other method.[79]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince C# 3.0 the syntactic sugar of auto-implemented properties is available,[82] where the accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) encapsulate operations on a single attribute of a class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA C# namespace provides the same level of code isolation as a Java package or a C++ namespace, with very similar rules and features to a package. Namespaces can be imported with the \"using\" syntax.[83]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn C#, memory address pointers can only be used within blocks specifically marked as unsafe,[84] and programs with unsafe code need appropriate permissions to run. Most object access is done through safe object references, which always either point to a \"live\" object or have the well-defined null value; it is impossible to obtain a reference to a \"dead\" object (one that has been garbage collected), or to a random block of memory. An unsafe pointer can point to an instance of an unmanaged value type that does not contain any references to objects subject to garbage collections such as class instances, arrays or strings. Code that is not marked as unsafe can still store and manipulate pointers through the System.IntPtr type, but it cannot dereference them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManaged memory cannot be explicitly freed; instead, it is automatically garbage collected. Garbage collection addresses the problem of memory leaks by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing memory that is no longer needed in most cases. Code that retains references to objects longer than is required can still experience higher memory usage than necessary, however once the final reference to an object is released the memory is available for garbage collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA range of standard exceptions are available to programmers. Methods in standard libraries regularly throw system exceptions in some circumstances and the range of exceptions thrown is normally documented. Custom exception classes can be defined for classes allowing handling to be put in place for particular circumstances as needed.[85]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChecked exceptions are not present in C# (in contrast to Java). This has been a conscious decision based on the issues of scalability and versionability.[86]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike C++, C# does not support multiple inheritance, although a class can implement any number of \"interfaces\" (fully abstract classes). This was a design decision by the language\u0027s lead architect to avoid complications and to simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same name and taking parameters of the same type in the same order (i.e. the same signature), similar to Java, C# allows both a single method to cover all interfaces and if necessary specific methods for each interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, unlike Java, C# supports operator overloading.[87]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# also offers function overloading (a.k.a. ad-hoc-polymorphism).[88]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince version 2.0, C# offers parametric polymorphism, i.e. classes with arbitrary or constrained type parameters, e.g. List\u003cT\u003e, a variable-sized array which only can contain elements of type T. There are certain kinds of constraints you can specify for the type parameters: Has to be type X (or one derived from it), has to implement a certain interface, has to be a reference type, has to be a value type, has to implement a public parameterless constructor. Most of them can be combined, and you can specify any number of interfaces.[89][90]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# has the ability to utilize LINQ through the .NET Framework. A developer can query a variety of data sources, provided the IEnumerable\u003cT\u003e interface is implemented on the object. This includes XML documents, an ADO.NET dataset, and SQL databases.[91]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing LINQ in C# brings advantages like IntelliSense support, strong filtering capabilities, type safety with compile error checking ability, and consistency for querying data over a variety of sources.[92] There are several different language structures that can be utilized with C# and LINQ and they are query expressions, lambda expressions, anonymous types, implicitly typed variables, extension methods, and object initializers.[93]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLINQ has two syntaxes: query syntax and method syntax. However, the compiler always converts the query syntax to method syntax at compile time.[94]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough primarily an imperative language, C# always adds functional features over time,[95][96] for example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# has a unified type system. This unified type system is called Common Type System (CTS).[103]:âPart 2, Chapter 4: The Type Systemâ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA unified type system implies that all types, including primitives such as integers, are subclasses of the System.Object class. For example, every type inherits a ToString() method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCTS separates data types into two categories:[103]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstances of value types neither have referential identity nor referential comparison semantics. Equality and inequality comparisons for value types compare the actual data values within the instances, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded. Value types are derived from System.ValueType, always have a default value, and can always be created and copied. Some other limitations on value types are that they cannot derive from each other (but can implement interfaces) and cannot have an explicit default (parameterless) constructor because they already have an implicit one which initializes all contained data to the type-dependent default value (0, null, or alike). Examples of value types are all primitive types, such as int (a signed 32-bit integer), float (a 32-bit IEEE floating-point number), char (a 16-bit Unicode code unit), decimal (fixed-point numbers useful for handling currency amounts), and System.DateTime (identifies a specific point in time with nanosecond precision). Other examples are enum (enumerations) and struct (user defined structures).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, reference types have the notion of referential identity, meaning that each instance of a reference type is inherently distinct from every other instance, even if the data within both instances is the same. This is reflected in default equality and inequality comparisons for reference types, which test for referential rather than structural equality, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded (such as the case for System.String). Some operations are not always possible, such as creating an instance of a reference type, copying an existing instance, or performing a value comparison on two existing instances. Though specific reference types can provide such services by exposing a public constructor or implementing a corresponding interface (such as ICloneable or IComparable). Examples of reference types are object (the ultimate base class for all other C# classes), System.String (a string of Unicode characters), and System.Array (a base class for all C# arrays).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth type categories are extensible with user-defined types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoxing is the operation of converting a value-type object into a value of a corresponding reference type.[103] Boxing in C# is implicit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnboxing is the operation of converting a value of a reference type (previously boxed) into a value of a value type.[103] Unboxing in C# requires an explicit type cast. A boxed object of type T can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T).[104]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C# specification details a minimum set of types and class libraries that the compiler expects to have available. In practice, C# is most often used with some implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which is standardized as ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the standard CLI specifications, there are many commercial and community class libraries that build on top of the .NET framework libraries to provide additional functionality.[105]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# can make calls to any library included in the List of .NET libraries and frameworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following is a very simple C# program, a version of the classic \"Hello world\" example using the top-level statements feature introduced in C# 9:[106]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor code written as C# 8 or lower, the entry point logic of a program must be written in a Main method inside a type:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis code will display this text in the console window:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach line has a purpose:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe above line imports all types in the System namespace. For example, the Console class used later in the source code is defined in the System namespace, meaning it can be used without supplying the full name of the type (which includes the namespace).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis line is a comment; it describes and documents the code for the programmer(s).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove is a class definition for the Program class. Everything that follows between the pair of braces describes that class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curly brackets demarcate the boundaries of a code block. In this first instance, they are marking the start and end of the Program class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis declares the class member method where the program begins execution. The .NET runtime calls the Main method. Unlike in Java, the Main method does not need the public keyword, which tells the compiler that the method can be called from anywhere by any class.[107] Writing static void Main(string[] args) is equivalent to writing private static void Main(string[] args). The static keyword makes the method accessible without an instance of Program. Each console application\u0027s Main entry point must be declared static otherwise the program would require an instance of Program, but any instance would require a program. To avoid that irresolvable circular dependency, C# compilers processing console applications (like that above) report an error if there is no static Main method. The void keyword declares that Main has no return value. (Note, however, that short programs can be written using Top Level Statements introduced in C# 9, as mentioned earlier.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis line writes the output. Console is a static class in the System namespace. It provides an interface to the standard input, output, and error streams for console applications. The program calls the Console method WriteLine, which displays on the console a line with the argument, the string \"Hello, world!\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith .NET 2.0 and C# 2.0, the community requested more flexible collections than those in .NET 1.x. In the absence of generics, developers had to use collections such as ArrayList to store elements as objects, which incurred performance overhead when boxing/unboxing operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerics introduced a massive new feature in .NET that allowed developers to create type-safe data structures. This shift is particularly important in the context of converting legacy systems, where updating to generics can significantly enhance performance and maintainability by replacing outdated data structures with more efficient, type-safe alternatives.[108]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvantages Of Generics:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafety of Type: The main advantage of generics is improved type safety. Generics impose compile-time type checking, requiring that only the correct type of data is used with the generic classes or methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerformance Benefits: Generics perform better because there is no boxing and unboxing involved when working with value types. In non-generic collections such as ArrayList value types are treated as objects meaning they should be boxed (converted out of a value type to an object type) when put into the collection along with unboxed (converted to the value type) when retrieved. This operation is computationally expensive. As generics typically have the type known at compile time, no boxing is required since operations are type-specific and thus much faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReusability: Generics make code much easier to reuse. By type parameters, a single generic class, method, interface or delegate might have any number of data types. This enables developers to design a type â independent function or data structure without worrying about overloading methods or creating multiple variants of the same class for different types. This not just makes the codebase easier but also causes it to be simpler to keep less code and also increases applicability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Windows GUI example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis example is similar to the previous example, except that it generates a dialog box that contains the message \"Hello, World!\" instead of writing it to the console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother useful library is the System.Drawing library, which is used to programmatically draw images. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will create an image that is identical to that stored in \"Image.png\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn August 2001, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Intel co-sponsored the submission of specifications for C# as well as the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to the standards organization Ecma International. In December 2001, ECMA released ECMA-334 C# Language Specification. C# became an ISO/IEC standard in 2003 (ISO/IEC 23270:2003 - Information technology â Programming languages â C#). ECMA had previously adopted equivalent specifications as the 2nd edition of C#, in December 2002. In June 2005, ECMA approved edition 3 of the C# specification, and updated ECMA-334. Additions included partial classes, anonymous methods, nullable types, and generics (somewhat similar to C++ templates). In July 2005, ECMA submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22, via the latter\u0027s Fast-Track process, the standards and related TRs. This process usually takes 6â9 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C# language definition and the CLI are standardized under ISO/IEC and Ecma standards that provide reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing protection from patent claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft initially agreed not to sue open-source developers for violating patents in non-profit projects for the part of the framework that is covered by the Open Specification Promise.[109] Microsoft has also agreed not to enforce patents relating to Novell products against Novell\u0027s paying customers[110] with the exception of a list of products that do not explicitly mention C#, .NET or Novell\u0027s implementation of .NET (The Mono Project).[111] However, Novell maintained that Mono does not infringe any Microsoft patents.[112] Microsoft also made a specific agreement not to enforce patent rights related to the Moonlight browser plugin, which depends on Mono, provided it is obtained through Novell.[113]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA decade later, Microsoft began developing free, open-source, and cross-platform tooling for C#, namely Visual Studio Code, .NET Core, and Roslyn. Mono joined Microsoft as a project of Xamarin, a Microsoft subsidiary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft is leading the development of the open-source reference C# compilers and set of tools. The first compiler, Roslyn, compiles into intermediate language (IL), and the second one, RyuJIT,[114] is a JIT (just-in-time) compiler, which is dynamic and does on-the-fly optimization and compiles the IL into native code for the front-end of the CPU.[115] RyuJIT is open source and written in C++.[116] Roslyn is entirely written in managed code (C#), has been opened up and functionality surfaced as APIs. It is thus enabling developers to create refactoring and diagnostics tools.[4][117] Two branches of official implementation are .NET Framework (closed-source, Windows-only) and .NET Core (open-source, cross-platform); they eventually converged into one open-source implementation: .NET 5.0.[118] At .NET Framework 4.6, a new JIT compiler replaced the former.[114][119]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther C# compilers (some of which include an implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure and .NET class libraries):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Unity game engine uses C# as its primary scripting language. The Godot game engine has implemented an optional C# module thanks to a donation of $24,000 from Microsoft.[120]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.w3schools.com/go/","html":"\u003cp\u003eW3Schools offers a wide range of services and products for beginners and professionals, helping millions of people everyday to learn and master new skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoy our free tutorials like millions of other internet users since 1999\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplore our selection of references covering all popular coding languages\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate your own website with W3Schools Spaces - no setup required\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTest your skills with different exercises\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTest yourself with multiple choice questions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocument your knowledge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate a free W3Schools Account to Improve Your Learning Experience\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrack your learning progress at W3Schools and collect rewards\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecome a PLUS user and unlock powerful features (ad-free, hosting, support,..)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot sure where you want to start?

Initially developed only for native iOS development, programmers also use Swift to write safe, concise, and easy-to-use code for operating systems like Windows and Linux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApple created Swift, an open-source programming language, as a replacement for all languages based on C, including Objective C, C++, and C. The language was created in 2014 and released to the public as an open-source project in 2015 on Swift.org.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn its short time as a programming language, Swift has climbed to the 20th most commonly used programming language worldwide and the 14th most popular language among programmers [1, 2].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore diving deeper into Swift, let\u0027s examine compatible programming environments. Swift is available on Windows and Linux in addition to macOS. As a result, you don\u0027t need a Mac to learn Swift. However, you will need a Mac to create iOS applications because you\u0027ll need to use Xcode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgramming in Swift is safe, fast, and relatively easy to use compared to older, more established languages like Objective-C. Other reasons to learn to program in Swift are the intuitive nature of the language and the tight-knit community built around the language. Learning programming in Swift is more accessible than with other languages, and youâll find more tools for learning the language. Consider the following features of the Swift programming language:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomatic Reference Counting (ARC). Determines which instances are no longer in use and automatically removes them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosures unified with function pointers. Function pointers contain the address of a specific function and point to code vs. data. Using a function pointer, you signify a particular behavior by calling the function instead of writing code. Closures contain these function pointers. Swiftâs nested functions mean that closures are unified with function pointers and can take values from the functions enclosed within the closure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuples and multiple return values. In Swift, you can return multiple values from a function instead of only one. Other C languages allow you to return multiple values using pointers, structures, or arrays. But Swift allows you to return multiple values from functions using tuples, returned as a single entity from a function. Tuples are unchangeable or fixed sets of elements arranged in an ordered sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerics. Generics help find errors in code by enabling types to be used as parameters. Generics in Swift allows users to write reusable functions and types that can work with any type in relation to the requirements you define.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast and concise iteration over a range or collection. Swift provides a simple way to loop over all elements in an array. An array is a collection of similar elements grouped together for easier referencing and indexing. Since Swift already knows what kind of data your array holds, it can quickly and efficiently run blocks of code by assigning every element in an array a constant you name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStructs that support methods, extensions, and protocols. Youâll find that when creating, naming, and using structs within Swift, you have the ability to add additional functionality using extensions, including the option to extend types even if you lack access to the original code source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunctional programming patterns. This function takes in an array and repeatedly computes a value, creating a pattern that will be returned to the code that called for that action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowerful built-in error handling. Error handling determines what happens when an error occurs, for example, when someone inputs a wrong password to a login. There are four ways to handle errors in Swift: throwing, catching, propagating, and manipulating recoverable errors at runtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvanced control flow with do, guard, defer, and repeat keywords. Swift uses control flow statements to control how a program runs. There are a few types of control flow statements, including control transfer statements, loop statements, and branch statements. You can access more advanced control flow features with Swiftâs do statement to introduce scope, guard to manage errors, defer statement to run clean-up actions, and repeat to allow for a block of code to run more than once, depending upon conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift is designed to be a safe, easy-to-use alternative to the more well-established Objective-C. As a result, there are many advantages to programming in Swift:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically designed to be safer than C-based languages, Swift eliminates entire classes of unsafe code as a preventative measure and allows for âcleanerâ code with fewer runtime crashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Swift, variables are initialized before use, arrays and integers are checked for overflow, and memory is automatically managed. Developers can also easily see any code errors, reducing the time spent on debugging and removing the risk of low-quality code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApple claims that search algorithms complete up to 2.6 times faster than Objective-C and up to 8.4 times faster than Python 2.7 [3]. Swift uses LLVM as its compiler framework, which translates the assembly language to the machine code and optimizes it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis means you use less code than you would with Objective-C, making development faster. Using Swift on both the back and front end of an app, for example, allows for extensive code sharing and reuse, speeding up the development process and reducing development efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse open-source Swift across major platforms like Windows and Linux. This makes the language particularly ideal for mobile developers. While Swift runs across other platforms, keep in mind youâll need cross-platform programs like Sublime Text or Atom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift is a programming language built to be incredibly user-friendly. From concise syntax to inferred type, code is made simpler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift is a widely available, free programming language. As an open-source language, youâll find third-party tools, help when you need it, and a knowledgeable community of like-minded users to help you learn Swift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate an entirely new application with Swift, or begin using Swift code to implement new features and functionality in your app. Swift code co-exists alongside existing Objective-C files in the same project, with full access to your Objective-C API, making it easy to adopt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there are many advantages of programming in Swift, there are some disadvantages to remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite its popularity, only 4.6 percent of developers worldwide use Swift [4]. There are many reasons to believe this community will only grow in size and knowledge base, but in the meantime, itâs something to consider when learning to program in Swift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift can also appear to be pigeonholed as only an iOS/Apple/Mac language because of the smaller community and features designed for use with Apple products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis misperception could be because Swift is a compiled rather than technical language, so more programmers are hesitant to cross over to Swift completely. As a result, it\u0027s not yet a widely adopted language in the developer community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift may not be as developed or supported as older languages, leaving some new to the language needing additional resources.

Although the bug is exploitable in the context of the PHP Engine, the bug is not in PHP. It is also not directly exploitable remotely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bug is exploitable, if and only if, the PHP application calls iconv functions or filters with user-supplied character sets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApplications are not vulnerable if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, when using a user-supplied character set, it is good practice for applications to accept only specific charsets that have been explicitly allowed by the application. One example of how this can be done is by using an allow-list and the array_search() function to check the encoding before passing it to iconv. For example: array_search($charset, $allowed_list, true)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are numerous reports online with titles like \"Mitigating the iconv Vulnerability for PHP (CVE-2024-2961)\" or \"PHP Under Attack\". These titles are misleading as this is not a bug in PHP itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf your PHP application is vulnerable, we first recommend to check if your Linux distribution has already published patched variants of glibc. Debian, CentOS, and others, have already done so, and please upgrade as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce an update is available in glibc, updating that package on your Linux machine will be enough to alleviate the issue. You do not need to update PHP, as glibc is a dynamically linked library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf your Linux distribution has not published a patched version of glibc, there is no fix for this issue. However, there exists a workaround described in GLIBC Vulnerability on Servers Serving PHP which explains a way on how to remove the problematic character set from glibc. Perform this procedure for every gconv-modules-extra.conf file that is available on your system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePHP users on Windows are not affected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, a new version of PHP will not be released for this vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PHP development team announces the immediate availability of PHP 8.1.28.

It was maintained mainly by Google and a community of individuals and corporations. It aimed to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side modelâviewâcontroller (MVC) and modelâviewâviewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in web applications and progressive web applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS was used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, that consisted of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework, AngularJS itself (or Angular), and Node.js server runtime environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of January 1, 2022, Google no longer updates AngularJS to fix security, browser compatibility, or jQuery issues.[3][4][5] The Angular team recommends upgrading to Angular (v2+) as the best path forward, but they also provided some other options.[6]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AngularJS framework worked by first reading the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page, which had additional custom HTML attributes embedded into it. Angular interpreted those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables could be manually set within the code or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS was built on the belief that declarative programming should be used to create user interfaces and connect software components, while imperative programming was better suited to defining an application\u0027s business logic.[7] The framework adapted and extended traditional HTML to present dynamic content through two-way data-binding that allowed for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS de-emphasized explicit Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation with the goal of improving testability and performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS\u0027s design goals included:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS implemented the MVC pattern to separate presentation, data, and logic components.[8] Using dependency injection, Angular brought traditionally server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server could be reduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS used the term \"scope\" in a manner akin to the fundamentals of computer science.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScope in computer science describes when in the program a particular binding is valid. The ECMA-262 specification defines scope as: a lexical environment in which a Function object is executed in client-side web scripts;[9] akin to how scope is defined in lambda calculus.[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a part of the \"MVC\" architecture, the scope forms the \"Model\", and all variables defined in the scope can be accessed by the \"View\" as well as the \"Controller\". The scope behaves as a glue and binds the \"View\" and the \"Controller\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe task performed by the AngularJS bootstrapper occurred in three phases[11] after the DOM has been loaded:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS directives allowed the developer to specify custom and reusable HTML-like elements and attributes that define data bindings and the behavior of presentation components. Some of the most commonly used directives were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince ng-* attributes are not valid in HTML specifications, data-ng-* can also be used as a prefix. For example, both ng-app and data-ng-app are valid in AngularJS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS two-way data binding had its most notable feature, largely relieving the server backend of templating responsibilities. Instead, templates were rendered in plain HTML according to data contained in a scope defined in the model. The $scope service in Angular detected changes to the model section and modified HTML expressions in the view via a controller. Likewise, any alterations to the view were reflected in the model. This circumvented the need to actively manipulate the DOM and encouraged bootstrapping and rapid prototyping of web applications.[13] AngularJS detected changes in models by comparing the current values with values stored earlier in a process of dirty-checking, unlike Ember.js and Backbone.js that triggered listeners when the model values are changed.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS was originally developed in 2009 by MiÅ¡ko Hevery[15] at Brat Tech LLC[16] as the software behind an online JSON storage service, that would have been priced by the megabyte, for easy-to-make applications for the enterprise. This venture was located at the web domain \"GetAngular.com\",[16] and had a few subscribers, before the two decided to abandon the business idea and release Angular as an open-source library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 1.6 release added many of the concepts of Angular to AngularJS, including the concept of a component-based application architecture.[17] This release among others removed the Sandbox, which many developers believed provided additional security, despite numerous vulnerabilities that had been discovered that bypassed the sandbox.[18] The current (as of November 2023) stable release of AngularJS is 1.8.3[19]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January 2018, a schedule was announced for phasing-out AngularJS: after releasing 1.7.0, the active development on AngularJS would continue until June 30, 2018. Afterwards, 1.7 was supported until December 31, 2021 as long-term support.[4][5]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVersions 1.3 and later of AngularJS did not support Internet Explorer 8 or earlier. While AngularJS 1.2 supported IE8, its team does not.[20][21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubsequent versions of AngularJS are simply called Angular.[22] Angular is an incompatible TypeScript-based rewrite of AngularJS. Angular 4 was announced on 13 December 2016, skipping 3 to avoid a confusion due to the misalignment of the router package\u0027s version which was already distributed as v3.3.0.[23]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularDart works on Dart, which is an object-oriented, class defined, single inheritance programming language using C style syntax, that is different from Angular JS (which uses JavaScript) and Angular 2/ Angular 4 (which uses TypeScript). Angular 4 released in March 2017, with the framework\u0027s version aligned with the version number of the router it used. Angular 5 was released on November 1, 2017.[24] Key improvements in Angular 5 include support for progressive Web apps, a build optimizer and improvements related to Material Design.[25] Angular 6 was released on 3 May 2018,[26] Angular 7 was released on 18 October 2018, and Angular 8 was released on May 28, 2019. Angular follows Semantic Versioning standards, with each major version number indicating potentially breaking changes. Angular has pledged to provide 6 months of active support for each major version followed by 12 months of long-term support. Major releases are bi-yearly with 1 to 3 minor releases for every major release.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA normal Angular application executes in the browser, while Angular Universal generates static application pages on the server through server-side rendering (SSR).[28]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS Material[29][30] was a UI component library that implemented Material Design in AngularJS.[31] The library provided a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components. In January 2022, the library was closed, as announced on their official website.[32] The AngularJS Material library is a mature and stable product that is ready for production use and works only with AngularJS 1.x. The Angular Material library is available in the angular/material2 GitHub repository.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July 2012, the Angular team built an extension for the Google Chrome browser called Batarang,[33] that improved the debugging experience for web applications built with Angular. The extension aimed to allow for easy detection of performance bottlenecks and offered a GUI for debugging applications.[34] For a time during late 2014 and early 2015, the extension was not compatible with recent releases (after v1.2.x) of Angular.[35] The last update made to this extension was on April 4, 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS set out the paradigm of a digest cycle. This cycle could be considered a loop, during which AngularJS checked if there were any changes to all the variables watched by all the $scopes. If $scope.myVar is defined in a controller and this variable was marked for watching, Angular would monitor the changes on myVar in each loop iteration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach potentially led to slow rendering when AngularJS checked on too many variables in the $scope every cycle.

Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool among 86,544 respondents, with 73.71% reporting that they use it. [12]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015 by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A preview build was released shortly thereafter.[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn November 18, 2015, the source code of Visual Studio Code was released under the MIT License and made available on GitHub. Extension support was also announced.[14] On April 14, 2016, Visual Studio Code graduated from the public preview stage and was released to the web.[15] Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code\u0027s source code on GitHub under the permissive MIT License,[5][16] while the editor itself is distributed by Microsoft as proprietary freeware.[7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including C, C#, C++, Fortran, Go, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Rust, and Julia.[17][18][19][20][21] Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component (codenamed \"Monaco\") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called \"Visual Studio Online\" and \"Visual Studio Team Services\").[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe downloadable version of Visual Studio Code is built on the Electron framework,[23] which is used to develop Node.js web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. Visual Studio Code for the Web is a browser-based version of the editor that can be used to edit both local files and remote repositories (on GitHub and Microsoft Azure) without installing the full program.[24] It is officially supported and hosted by Microsoft and can be accessed at https://vscode.dev.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the box, Visual Studio Code includes basic support for most common programming languages. This basic support includes syntax highlighting, bracket matching, code folding, and configurable snippets. Visual Studio Code also ships with IntelliSense for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, and HTML, as well as debugging support for Node.js. Support for additional languages can be provided by freely available extensions on the VS Code Marketplace.[25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of a project system, it allows users to open one or more directories, which can then be saved in workspaces for future reuse. This allows it to operate as a language-agnostic code editor for any language. It supports many programming languages and a set of features that differs per language. Unwanted files and folders can be excluded from the project tree via settings. Many Visual Studio Code features are not exposed through menus or the user interface but can be accessed via the command palette.[26] The command palette is able to execute virtually every feature the graphical interface supports, making it very keyboard-accessible.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisual Studio Code can be extended via extensions,[28] available through a central repository. This includes additions to the editor[29] and language support.[26] A notable feature is the ability to create extensions that add support for new languages, themes, debuggers, time travel debuggers, perform static code analysis, and add code linters using the Language Server Protocol.[30]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource control is a built-in feature of Visual Studio Code. It has a dedicated tab inside of the menu bar where users can access version control settings and view changes made to the current project. To use the feature, Visual Studio Code must be linked to any supported version control system (Git, Apache Subversion, Perforce, etc.). This allows users to create repositories as well as to make push and pull requests directly from the Visual Studio Code program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve the product. This telemetry feature can be disabled.[31] The information contained in this telemetry data can be inspected by the public, since the product is open source.[32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nightly build called Visual Studio Code Insiders is also available. Its configuration, including any settings, extensions, themes are completely separate from the standard build. This enables side-by-side installation of both builds without any interference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2016 Developers Survey of Stack Overflow, Visual Studio Code ranked No. 13 among the top popular development tools, with only 7% of the 47,000 respondents using it.[33] Two years later, however, Visual Studio Code achieved the No. 1 spot, with 35% of the 75,000 respondents using it.[34] In the 2019 Developers Survey, Visual Studio Code was also ranked No. 1, with 50% of the 87,000 respondents using it.[35] The 2020 Developers Survey did not cover integrated development environments.[36] In the 2021 Developers Survey, Visual Studio Code continued to be ranked No. 1, with 74.5% of the 71,000 respondents using it,[37] 74.48% of the 71,010 responses in the 2022 survey,[38] and 73.71% of the 86,544 responses in the 2023 survey.[39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 20, 2023, during the Guangdong Province\u0027s Digital Government Innovation Development Forum held in Guangzhou, CEC-IDE was released and described as the first Chinese-produced integrated development tool.[40][41] However, CEC-IDE was subsequently found to be a rebranded release of Visual Studio Code that, among other things, failed to include a copy of the MIT license as required for redistributions.

A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages are beginning to appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabases have evolved dramatically since their inception in the early 1960s. Navigational databases such as the hierarchical database (which relied on a tree-like model and allowed only a one-to-many relationship), and the network database (a more flexible model that allowed multiple relationships), were the original systems used to store and manipulate data. Although simple, these early systems were inflexible. In the 1980s, relational databases became popular, followed by object-oriented databases in the 1990s. More recently, NoSQL databases came about as a response to the growth of the internet and the need for faster speed and processing of unstructured data. Today, cloud databases and self-driving databases are breaking new ground when it comes to how data is collected, stored, managed, and utilized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabases and spreadsheets (such as Microsoft Excel) are both convenient ways to store information. The primary differences between the two are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpreadsheets were originally designed for one user, and their characteristics reflect that. Theyâre great for a single user or small number of users who donât need to do a lot of incredibly complicated data manipulation. Databases, on the other hand, are designed to hold much larger collections of organized informationâmassive amounts, sometimes. Databases allow multiple users at the same time to quickly and securely access and query the data using highly complex logic and language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many different types of databases. The best database for a specific organization depends on how the organization intends to use the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are only a few of the several dozen types of databases in use today. Other, less common databases are tailored to very specific scientific, financial, or other functions. In addition to the different database types, changes in technology development approaches and dramatic advances such as the cloud and automation are propelling databases in entirely new directions. Some of the latest databases include\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase software is used to create, edit, and maintain database files and records, enabling easier file and record creation, data entry, data editing, updating, and reporting. The software also handles data storage, backup and reporting, multi-access control, and security. Strong database security is especially important today, as data theft becomes more frequent. Database software is sometimes also referred to as a âdatabase management systemâ (DBMS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase software makes data management simpler by enabling users to store data in a structured form and then access it. It typically has a graphical interface to help create and manage the data and, in some cases, users can construct their own databases by using database software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA database typically requires a comprehensive database software program known as a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS serves as an interface between the database and its end users or programs, allowing users to retrieve, update, and manage how the information is organized and optimized. A DBMS also facilitates oversight and control of databases, enabling a variety of administrative operations such as performance monitoring, tuning, and backup and recovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome examples of popular database software or DBMSs include MySQL, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, FileMaker Pro, Oracle Database, and dBASE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMySQL is an open source relational database management system based on SQL. It was designed and optimized for web applications and can run on any platform. As new and different requirements emerged with the internet, MySQL became the platform of choice for web developers and web-based applications. Because itâs designed to process millions of queries and thousands of transactions, MySQL is a popular choice for ecommerce businesses that need to manage multiple money transfers. On-demand flexibility is the primary feature of MySQL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMySQL is the DBMS behind some of the top websites and web-based applications in the world, including Airbnb, Uber, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith massive data collection from the Internet of Things transforming life and industry across the globe, businesses today have access to more data than ever before. Forward-thinking organizations can now use databases to go beyond basic data storage and transactions to analyze vast quantities of data from multiple systems. Using database and other computing and business intelligence tools, organizations can now leverage the data they collect to run more efficiently, enable better decision-making, and become more agile and scalable. Optimizing access and throughput to data is critical to businesses today because there is more data volume to track. Itâs critical to have a platform that can deliver the performance, scale, and agility that businesses need as they grow over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe self-driving database is poised to provide a significant boost to these capabilities. Because self-driving databases automate expensive, time-consuming manual processes, they free up business users to become more proactive with their data. By having direct control over the ability to create and use databases, users gain control and autonomy while still maintaining important security standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTodayâs large enterprise databases often support very complex queries and are expected to deliver nearly instant responses to those queries. As a result, database administrators are constantly called upon to employ a wide variety of methods to help improve performance. Some common challenges that they face include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAddressing all of these challenges can be time-consuming and can prevent database administrators from performing more strategic functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelf-driving databases are the wave of the futureâand offer an intriguing possibility for organizations that want to use the best available database technology without the headaches of running and operating that technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelf-driving databases use cloud-based technology and machine learning to automate many of the routine tasks required to manage databases, such as tuning, security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks. With these tedious tasks automated, database administrators are freed up to do more strategic work. The self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing capabilities of self-driving databases are poised to revolutionize how companies manage and secure their data, enabling performance advantages, lower costs, and improved security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first autonomous database was announced in late 2017, and multiple independent industry analysts quickly recognized the technology and its potential impact on computing.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms","html":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027re seeing this message, it means we\u0027re having trouble loading external resources on our website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027re behind a web filter, please make sure that the domains *.kastatic.org and *.kasandbox.org are unblocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo log in and use all the features of Khan Academy, please enable JavaScript in your browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve partnered with Dartmouth college professors Tom Cormen and Devin Balkcom to teach introductory computer science algorithms, including searching, sorting, recursion, and graph theory.

Focus changed to compiling Dart code to JavaScript.[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDart 2.0 was released in August 2018 with language changes including a type system.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDart 2.6 introduced a new extension, dart2native. This extended native compilation to the Linux, macOS, and Windows desktop platforms.[15] Earlier developers could create new tools using only Android or iOS devices. With this extension, developers could deploy a program into self-contained executables. The Dart SDK doesn\u0027t need to be installed to run these self-contained executables.[16] The Flutter toolkit integrates Dart, so it can compile on small services like backend support.[17][18]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDart 3.0 was released in May 2023[19] with changes to the type system to require sound null safety. This release included new features like records, patterns,[20] and class modifiers.[21] Dart 3 also previewed support for Web Assembly.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDart released the 5th edition of its language specification on April 9, 2021.[23] This covers all syntax through Dart 2.10. A draft of the 6th edition includes all syntax through 2.13.[24] Accepted proposals for the specification and drafts of potential features can be found in the Dart language repository on GitHub.[25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eECMA International formed technical committee, TC52,[26] to standardize Dart. ECMA approved the first edition of the Dart language specification as ECMA-408[27] in July 2014 at its 107th General Assembly.[28] Subsequent editions were approved in December 2014,[29] June 2015, and December 2015.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dart software development kit (SDK) ships with a standalone Dart runtime. This allows Dart code to run in a command-line interface environment. The SDK includes tools to compile and package Dart apps.[30] Dart ships with a complete standard library allowing users to write fully working system apps like custom web servers.[31]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevelopers can deploy Dart apps in six ways:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDart 3 can deploy apps to the web as either JavaScript or WebAssembly apps. WebAssembly support is offered as a preview only as of May 2023[update].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDart can compile to native machine code for macOS, Windows, and Linux as command line tools. Dart can compile apps with user interfaces to the web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux using the Flutter framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo achieve concurrency, Dart uses isolated, independent workers that do not share memory, but use message passing,[45] similarly to Erlang processes (also see actor model). Every Dart program uses at least one isolate, which is the main isolate. Since Dart 2, the Dart web platform no longer supports isolates, and suggests developers use Web Workers instead.[46]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting with Dart 2.12, Dart introduced sound null safety.[47] This serves as a guarantee that variables cannot return a null value unless it has explicit permission. Null safety prevents the developer from introducing null-pointer exceptions, a common, but difficult to debug, error. With Dart 3, all code must follow sound null safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnapshot files, a core part of the Dart VM, store objects and other runtime data.[45]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn November 18, 2011, Google released Dart Editor, an open-source program based on Eclipse components, for macOS, Windows, and Linux-based operating systems.[49] The editor supports syntax highlighting, code completion, JavaScript compiling, running web and server Dart applications, and debugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn August 13, 2012, Google announced the release of an Eclipse plugin for Dart development.[50]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn April 18, 2015, Google retired the Dart Editor in favor of the JetBrains integrated development environment (IDE).[51] Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, PhpStorm and WebStorm support a Dart plugin.[52] This plugin supports many features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, analysis, refactoring, debugging, and more. Other editors include plugins for Dart[53] including Sublime Text,[54] Atom,[55] Emacs,[56] Vim[57] and Visual Studio Code.[58]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2013, the Chromium team began work on an open source, Chrome App-based development environment with a reusable library of GUI widgets, codenamed Spark.[59] The project was later renamed as Chrome Dev Editor.[60] Built in Dart, it contained Spark which is powered by Polymer.[61]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2015, Google transferred the CDE project to GitHub as a free software project and ceased active investment in CDE.[62] The Chrome Dev Editor project was archived on April 24, 2021.[63]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo provide an easier way to start using Dart, the Dart team created DartPad at the start of 2015. This online editor allows developers to experiment with Dart application programming interfaces (APIs) and run Dart code. It provides syntax highlighting, code analysis, code completion, documentation, and HTML and CSS editing.[64]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dart DevTools, written in Dart,[65] include debugging and performance tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle introduced Flutter for native app development. Built using Dart, C, C++ and Skia, Flutter is an open-source, multi-platform app UI framework. Prior to Flutter 2.0, developers could only target Android, iOS and the web. Flutter 2.0 released support for macOS, Linux, and Windows as a beta feature.[66] Flutter 2.10 released with production support for Windows[67] and Flutter 3 released production support for all desktop platforms.[68] It provides a framework, widgets, and tools. This framework gives developers a way to build and deploy mobile, desktop, and web apps.[69] Flutter works with Firebase[70] and supports extending the framework through add-ons called packages. These can be found on their package repository, pub.dev.[71] JetBrains also supports a Flutter plugin.[72]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Hello, World! example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA simple for-loop:[73]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA simple class:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDart belongs to the ALGOL language family.[74][failed verification] Its members include C, Java, C#, JavaScript, and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe method cascade syntax was adopted from Smalltalk.[75] This syntax provides a shortcut for invoking several methods one after another on the same object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDart\u0027s mixins were influenced by Strongtalk[citation needed][76][77] and Ruby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDart makes use of isolates as a concurrency and security unit when structuring applications.[78] The Isolate concept builds upon the Actor model implemented in Erlang.[79]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2004, Gilad Bracha (who was a member of the Dart team) and David Ungar first proposed Mirror API for performing controlled and secure reflection in a paper.[80] The concept was first implemented in Self.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-structure-tutorial/what-is-data-structure","html":"\u003cp\u003eData is one of the most powerful tools available to any business or organization that wants to not only survive but rise to the top in todayâs competitive and challenging world.

Weâll cover resources like data structure interview questions, perfect for people applying for a related position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetâs dive right into the world of data structures and algorithms\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore defining data structures, letâs back up a little and ask, âWhat is data?â Hereâs a quick answer: Data is information optimized for processing and movement, facts and figures stored on computers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData structures are a specific way of organizing data in a specialized format on a computer so that the information can be organized, processed, stored, and retrieved quickly and effectively. They are a means of handling information, rendering the data for easy use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery application, piece of software, or programs foundation consists of two components: algorithms and data. Data is information, and algorithms are rules and instructions that turn the data into something useful to programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePut another way, remember these two simple equations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated data + Permissible operations on the data \u003d Data Structures\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData structures + Algorithms \u003d Programs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated learning: What Is An Algorithm?

The characteristics of Data Structures are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis characteristic arranges the data in sequential order, such as arrays, graphs etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatic data structures have fixed formats and sizes along with memory locations. The static characteristic shows the compilation of the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time factor should be very punctual. The running time or the execution time of a program should be limited. The running time should be as less as possible. The less the running time, the more accurate the device is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach data must definitely have an interface. Interface depicts the set of data structures. Data Structure should be implemented accurately in the interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Space in the device should be managed carefully. The memory usage should be used properly. The space should be less occupied, which indicates the proper function of the device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData elements in a linear data structure are linked to one another in a sequential arrangement, with each element linked to the elements in front of and behind it. In this manner, a single run can traverse the structure. Linear data structures consist of four types. They are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe linear data structure stores the data elements in the âfirst-in/ last-outâ or the âlast-in/ first outâ order. These orders are known as FILO and LIFO orders, respectively. By using Stack, the element can be added and removed simultaneously from the same end. In Python, Stack can be developed in the following ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Stack, the terms âPushâ and âPopâ are used instead of âinsertâ and âdeleteâ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the collection of similar data types that are stored in the Contiguous Memory Locations. Arrays are used in Python as well. Arrays work on the scale of 0 to (n-1), where ânâ denotes the size of the array. Arrays are of two types. They are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO order. FIFO stands for First In and First Out. The order is that the elements which are inserted first are to be removed first. The properties of Queue data structure are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinked Lists separate the data structures that are stored consecutively. The last node of a data structure will be linked to the first node of the next data structure. The first element of any data structure is known as the Head of the List. The linked list helps in memory allocation, stores data in internal structure etc. There are three types of Linked Lists. They are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe data structure in which the data elements are randomly arranged. The elements are non-arranged sequentially. The data elements are present at different levels. In Non-linear data structures, there are different paths for an element to reach the other element. The data elements in the non-linear data structures are connected to one or more elements. There are two types of non-linear data structures. They are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTree data structures are completely different from the arrays, stacks, queues and linked lists. Tree data structures are hierarchic. The tree data structure collects the nodes together to depict and stimulate the sequence. Tree data structure does not store the data sequentially. It stores the data on multiple levels. The top node of the Tree Data Structure is known as the Root Node. Any type of data can be stored in the root node. Each node shall definitely contain the data. The branches in the Tree Data Structure are known as the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe different parts of the Tree Data Structure are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Graph Data Structure, one node is simply connected to the other node through the edge of the graph. The Graph Data Structure obviously uses Non-linear data structures which are not sequentially arranged. The graph data structures consist of edges and nodes represented by E and V, respectively. Graph Data Structures do not have root nodes. It does not have a standard order of arranging the data. Every tree is also known as the graph with n-1 edges where ânâ represents the total number of vertices in the graph. There are various categories in the graphs such as undirected, unweighted, directed and weighted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe different parts of the graph are as follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData types are the basic elements in the classification of the data. Data types are used in the transmission of information between the programmer and the compiler. There are different data types. They are as follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn computer programs, there are three types of data such as numbers, text and booleans. Boolean is a data type, and the value in the boolean can be either false or true or positive or negative. A boolean type of data proves whether the data is valid or invalid. Boolean values have two possible states such as True or False. In the binary system, the values 0 and 1 are used. Boolean expressions deal with algebra, logical values and binary variables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe integer data type stores both positive numbers and negative numbers along with zero. The integer data type uses all these integers to maintain precision. All the arithmetic operations can be efficiently done through integer data types. If the value of data is beyond the numerical range of the integer then it is the case that the database server cannot store the value. However, integer data type consumes four(4) bytes of storage per value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA floating-point data type approximates real values using a formula in order to allow a trade-off between range and precision. Due to the need for quick processing speeds, systems with extremely small and very large real numbers are frequently found to use floating-point calculation. An exponent in a fixed base is typically used to scale a number and approximate its representation to a specific number of significant digits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBinary words are used to store numbers in digital electronics. A fixed-length string of bits (1s and 0s) is a binary word. The data type determines how these 1s and 0s are interpreted by hardware elements and software processes. There are two different data types for binary numbers: fixed-point and floating-point. Both signed and unsigned fixed-point data formats are available. There is no sign bit. Therefore the binary word does not typically explicitly express whether a fixed-point value is signed or unsigned. In contrast, the architecture of the computer implicitly defines the sign information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBinary words are used to store numbers in digital electronics. A fixed-length string of bits (1s and 0s) is referred to as a binary word. The data type determines how these 1s and 0s are interpreted by hardware elements and software processes. There are two different data types for binary numbers: fixed-point and floating-point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharacter information is stored in a fixed-length field by the CHAR data type. Data can be a string of letters, integers, and other characters that are supported by the code set of your database locale, whether they are single-byte or multibyte characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings with a fixed length or a variable length can be used to hold character data. Variable-length strings are not extended; fixed-length strings are right-extended with spaces on output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlocks of memory that are dynamically allocated are managed and stored using pointers. Data objects or arrays of objects are stored in such alliances. The heap or free store, which is a memory space provided by the majority of structured and object-oriented languages, is where objects are dynamically allocated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA string data type consists of a series of characters, either in the form of a literal constant or a variable. The latter can either be constant in length or allow its elements to alter (after creation). An array data structure of bytes (or words) is frequently used to create a string, which is typically thought of as a sort of data and contains a succession of items, typically characters, using some kind of character encoding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImplementing the physical representations of abstract data types uses data structures. When creating effective software, data structures are a key component. They are also essential to the design of algorithms and the use of those algorithms in software. The data structures are used in different aspects, such as,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen providing the set of attributes and matching structures that will be used to store records in a database management system, data structures are utilised to efficiently persist data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData structures, including linked lists for memory allocation, file directory management and file structure trees, as well as process scheduling queues, are used to allow core operating system (OS) resources and functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInformation shared across applications, such as TCP/IP packets, is organised using data structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBinary search trees, sometimes referred to as ordered or sorted binary trees, are data structures that offer practical ways to sort things, such as character strings used as tags. Programmers can control objects arranged in a given priority using data structures like priority queues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo index items, such as those kept in a database, even more complex data structures like B-trees are utilised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB-trees, hash tables, and binary search trees are standard techniques used to generate indexes that speed up the process of finding a particular item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData structures are used by big data applications to allocate and manage data storage across distributed storage sites, assuring performance and scalability. To make querying easier, several big data programming environments, like Apache Spark, offer data structures that replicate the fundamental structure of database entries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe steps to be used in choosing the data structure are given below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1) The first step in determining the basic operations that must be supported is to analyse the problem. Inserting a data item into the data structure, deleting a data item from the data structure, and finding a specific data item are examples of basic operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2)Identify the resource constraints for each operation and quantify them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3) Determine which data structure best meets these requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the underlying data type of an attribute can be translated into one of the kinds for which an operation is supported, processes between the data types not included in the table can be carried out. Data can have numbers added or subtracted from them. The number of days to be added or removed is represented by integers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, since IEG INT8 is turned into IEG DOUBLE and the addition of IEG DOUBLE and IEG MONEY is supported, the addition of IEG INT8 and IEG MONEY is possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComputational complexity is a metric for how much time and memory (resources) a specific algorithm uses when it is executed. Before developing the code, computer scientists can forecast an algorithm\u0027s execution time and memory needs using mathematical metrics of complexity. For programmers implementing and choosing algorithms for practical applications, these predictions are essential guides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of those things that are simple to recognise but difficult to define is an elegant programme. It uses words effectively without resorting to obfuscation. It is succinct without employing complicated code. It strikes a balance between the concepts of simplicity and explicitness, coding complexity while staying superficial to read and understand. Writing the coding equivalent of flawless writing is every programmer\u0027s ultimate ambition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no \"magic solution\" or one solution to this issue. Coding standards can be used to aid, but they must be founded on a solid framework that ensures the core of the matter is conveyed to the programmer and reflected in the code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo answer the question of what is data structure, there are three basic data types to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbstract data is defined by how it behaves. This type encompasses graphs, queues, stacks, and sets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComposite data comprises combined primitive data types and includes arrays, classes, records, strings, and structs. They may also consist of other composite types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrimitive data is classified as basic data and consists of Boolean, characters, integers, pointers, and fixed- and floating-point numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese data types are the building blocks of data structures. Data types tell the interpreter or the computer how the programmer plans on using the data. Furthermore, data analysts can choose from different data structure classifications. The trick is to select the structure best suited for your needs and situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is data structure? Good question! It has so many definitions and characteristics, itâs easy to get confused and overwhelmed with the terminology. There are different types and classifications of data structures and the data itself, as we\u0027ve just seen. This volume of information brings even more questions. What is a linked list? What is a linear data structure? What is data structure???!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetâs try to make sense of data structures by looking at the classifications. There are three main data structure classifications, each consisting of a pair of characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinear structures arrange data in a linear sequence, such as found in an array, list, or queue. In nonlinear structures, the data doesnât form a sequence but instead connects to two or more information items, like in a tree or graph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the term implies, static structures consist of fixed, permanent structures and sizes at compile time. The array reserves a set amount of reserve memory set up by the programmer ahead of time. Dynamic structures feature non-fixed memory capacities, shrinking or expanding as required by the program and its execution requirements. Additionally, the location of the associated memory can change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomogenous data structures consist of the same data element type, like element collections found in an array. In non-homogenous structures, the data donât have to be the same type, such as structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrangement of the data elements\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of a linear data structure, the data items are stored in a linear order. Every element is linked to the first and next elements in the sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of a non-linear data structure, the data pieces are ordered non-linearly and attached hierarchically.

It has no hierarchy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are several layers involved in this arrangement.

Our walk through the many elements of data structures continues with a look at the different types of data structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrays are collections of data items that are of the same type, stored together in adjoining memory locations. Each data item is known as an âelement.â Arrays are the most basic, fundamental data structure. Aspiring Data Scientists should master array construction before moving on to other structures such as queues or stacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraphs are a nonlinear pictorial representation of element sets. Graphs consist of finite node sets, also called vertices, connected by links, alternately called edges. Trees, mentioned below, are a graph variation, except the latter has no rules governing how the nodes connect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHash tables, also called hash maps, can be used as either a linear or nonlinear data structure, though they favor the former. This structure is normally built using arrays. Hash tables map keys to values. For example, every book in a library has a unique number assigned to it that facilitates looking up information about the book, like who has checked it out, its current availability, etc. The books in the library are hashed to a unique number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinked lists store item collections in a linear order. Each element in a linked list contains a data item and a link, or reference, to the subsequent item on the same list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacks store collections of items in a linear order and are used when applying the operations. For example, the order could be âfirst in, first outâ (FIFO) or âlast in, first outâ (LIFO).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueues store item collections sequentially like stacks, but the operation order must be âfirst in, first outâ only. Queues are linear lists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso Read: Queue Implementation Using Array\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrees store item collections in an abstract hierarchy. They are multilevel data structures that use nodes. The bottom nodes are called âleaf nodes,â while the topmost node is known as the âroot node.â Each node has pointers that point to adjacent nodes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot to be confused with a Tree, Tries are data structures that store strings like data items and are placed in a visual graph. Tries are also called keyword trees or prefix trees. Whenever you use a search engine and receive autosuggestions, youâre witnessing the trie data structure in action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tree is considered a general tree if its hierarchy is not constrained. There is no limit on the number of children that a node can have in the General Tree. All other trees are subsets of the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA binary tree is a sort of tree data structure in which each parent node has no more than two child nodes. As the name implies, binary means two, therefore each node might have zero, one, or two nodes. The popularity of this tree is higher than that of most others. A Binary tree may be modified to accommodate certain limitations and features, such as by using the AVL tree, the BST tree, the RBT tree, and others. We will go through all of these styles in depth as we progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese tree data structures are non-linear, with one node connecting to several others. At most two child nodes can be attached to the node. A binary search tree is so named because:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. Adelson-Velshi and Landis are the inventors behind the term AVL. Dynamically balanced trees were first created here. Based on whether the AVL tree is balanced or not, each node is assigned a balancing factor. The node kids have a maximum height of one AVL vine. The right balance factors in the AVL tree are 1, 0, and -1. If a new node is added to the tree, it will be rotated to ensure that it is balanced. Then it will be rotated. In the AVL tree, common operations like viewing, insertion, and removal require O(log n) time. It is usually used while doing Lookups activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA B Tree is a more generic binary search tree. A height-balanced m way tree refers to this type of tree, where m denotes the order of the tree. Each tree node can have multiple keys and more than two child nodes. The leaf nodes of a binary tree may not be at the same level. It is important that all leaf nodes in a B Tree be equal in height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe order zero graphs is another name for the Null Graph. A graph with an empty edge set is referred to as a \"null graph.\" As the name implies, a null graph has 0 edges and consists only of isolated vertices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a graph contains only one vertex, it is called a trivial graph. One vertex is all that is needed to construct the trivial graph, which is the smallest possible graph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the number of vertices and edges in the graph is restricted, the graph is termed a finite graph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the number of vertices and edges in the graph is infinite, the graph is called finite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigraphs is another term for directed graphs. A graph is called a directed graph or digraph if all of the edges connecting any of its vertices or nodes are directed or have a definite direction. By directed edges, we mean graph edges that have a direction to indicate where they begin and where they stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery pair of nodes or vertices in a simple graph has just one edge connecting them. As a consequence, only one edge connects two vertices, illustrating one-to-one interactions between two components.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen there are many edges connecting two vertices in a graph G\u003d (V, E), the graph is called a multigraph. A Multigraph has no self-loops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA graph is complete if it is a simple graph. Edges having an n number of vertices must be linked. It is also known as a complete graph since the degree of each vertex must be n-1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pseudograph is one that has a self-loop in addition to other edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA regular graph is one such category of graph type that is a simple graph along with the exact same value of the degree at each of the vertices. As a result, every graph on its whole is a regular graph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBipartite graphs can be divided into two non-empty disjoint parts with the same vertex set. V1(G) and V2(G) so that each edge e of E(G) has one end in V1(G) and the other end in V2(G) (G). Bipartite of G refers to the partition V1 U V2 \u003d V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA labeled or weighted graph is one with each edge having a value or weight expressing the expense of crossing that edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe graph is linked if there is a path connecting one vertex of a graph data structure to any other vertex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen there is no edge connecting the vertices, the null graph is referred to as a disconnected graph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA graph is termed cyclic if it has at least one graph cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA graph is said to be acyclic if it contains no cycles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a type of graph data structure which has directed edges but no cycle, and it is also termed a DAG. The full form of DAG is a directed acyclic graph. Because it guides the vertices and maintains certain data, it depicts the edges with an ordered pair of vertices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA subgraph is a set of vertices and edges in one graph that are subsets of another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following are the most frequent operations that may be done on data structures:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated learning: Time and Space Complexity in Data Structure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three situations that are commonly used to compare the execution time of various data structures in a relative way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important things to learn when you seek the answer to your question â what is data structure?

By structure, it is meant that any program can be written in this structure only. Writing a C program in any other structure will hence lead to a Compilation Error. The structure of a C program is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first and foremost component is the inclusion of the Header files in a C program. A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. All lines that start with # are processed by a preprocessor which is a program invoked by the compiler. In the above example, the preprocessor copies the preprocessed code of stdio.h to our file. The .h files are called header files in C. Some of the C Header files:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next part of a C program is to declare the main() function. It is the entry point of a C program and the execution typically begins with the first line of the main(). The empty brackets indicate that the main doesnât take any parameter (See this for more details). The int that was written before the main indicates the return type of main(). The value returned by the main indicates the status of program termination. See this post for more details on the return type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe body of a function in the C program refers to statements that are a part of that function. It can be anything like manipulations, searching, sorting, printing, etc. A pair of curly brackets define the body of a function. All functions must start and end with curly brackets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatements are the instructions given to the compiler. In C, a statement is always terminated by a semicolon (;). In this particular case, we use printf() function to instruct the compiler to display âHello Worldâ text on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last part of any C function is the return statement. The return statement refers to the return values from a function. This return statement and return value depend upon the return type of the function. The return statement in our program returns the value from main(). The returned value may be used by an operating system to know the termination status of your program. The value 0 typically means successful termination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to execute the above program, we need to first compile it using a compiler and then we can run the generated executable.

It means that while implementing the algorithm, there can be more than one method to implement it. For example, in the above problem of adding 3 numbers, the sum can be calculated in many ways:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a standard algorithm to be good, it must be efficient. Hence the efficiency of an algorithm must be checked and maintained. It can be in two stages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eâPrioriâ means âbeforeâ. Hence Priori analysis means checking the algorithm before its implementation. In this, the algorithm is checked when it is written in the form of theoretical steps. This Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by assuming that all other factors, for example, processor speed, are constant and have no effect on the implementation. This is done usually by the algorithm designer. This analysis is independent of the type of hardware and language of the compiler. It gives the approximate answers for the complexity of the program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eâPosteriorâ means âafterâ. Hence Posterior analysis means checking the algorithm after its implementation. In this, the algorithm is checked by implementing it in any programming language and executing it. This analysis helps to get the actual and real analysis report about correctness(for every possible input/s if it shows/returns correct output or not), space required, time consumed, etc. That is, it is dependent on the language of the compiler and the type of hardware used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn algorithm is defined as complex based on the amount of Space and Time it consumes. Hence the Complexity of an algorithm refers to the measure of the time that it will need to execute and get the expected output, and the Space it will need to store all the data (input, temporary data, and output). Hence these two factors define the efficiency of an algorithm. The two factors of Algorithm Complexity are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore the complexity of an algorithm can be divided into two types:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Space Complexity: The space complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of memory required by the algorithm to store the variables and get the result. This can be for inputs, temporary operations, or outputs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to calculate Space Complexity? The space complexity of an algorithm is calculated by determining the following 2 components:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExample: Consider the below algorithm for Linear Search\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStep 1: START Step 2: Get n elements of the array in arr and the number to be searched in x Step 3: Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[] Step 4: If x matches with an element, Print True. Step 5: If x doesnât match with any of the elements, Print False. Step 6: END Here, There are 2 variables arr[], and x, where the arr[] is the variable part of n elements and x is the fixed part. Hence S(P) \u003d 1+n. So, the space complexity depends on n(number of elements). Now, space depends on data types of given variables and constant types and it will be multiplied accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of time required by the algorithm to execute and get the result. This can be for normal operations, conditional if-else statements, loop statements, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to Calculate, Time Complexity? The time complexity of an algorithm is also calculated by determining the following 2 components:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExample: In the algorithm of Linear Search above, the time complexity is calculated as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStep 1: âConstant Time Step 2: â Variable Time (Taking n inputs) Step 3: âVariable Time (Till the length of the Array (n) or the index of the found element) Step 4: âConstant Time Step 5: âConstant Time Step 6: âConstant Time Hence, T(P) \u003d 1 + n + n(1 + 1) + 1 \u003d 2 + 3n, which can be said as T(n).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://react.dev/","html":"\u003cp\u003eThe library for web and native user interfaces\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReact lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.

The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user\u0027s web browser.

Libuv is an abstraction layer for network and file system functionality on both Windows and POSIX-based systems such as Linux, macOS, OSS on NonStop, and Unix. Node.js relies on nghttp2 for HTTP support. As of version 20, Node.js uses the ada library which provides up-to-date WHATWG URL compliance. As of version 19.5, Node.js uses the simdutf library for fast Unicode validation and transcoding. As of version 21.3, Node.js uses the simdjson library for fast JSON parsing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNode.js operates on a single-thread event loop, using non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections without incurring the cost of thread context switching.[57] The design of sharing a single thread among all the requests that use the observer pattern is intended for building highly concurrent applications, where any function performing I/O must use a callback. To accommodate the single-threaded event loop, Node.js uses the libuv libraryâwhich, in turn, uses a fixed-sized thread pool that handles some of the non-blocking asynchronous I/O operations.[7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thread pool handles the execution of parallel tasks in Node.js. The main thread function call posts tasks to the shared task queue, which threads in the thread pool pull and execute. Inherently non-blocking system functions such as networking translate to kernel-side non-blocking sockets, while inherently blocking system functions such as file I/O run in a blocking way on their own threads. When a thread in the thread pool completes a task, it informs the main thread of this, which in turn, wakes up and executes the registered callback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA downside of this single-threaded approach is that Node.js does not allow vertical scaling by increasing the number of CPU cores of the machine it is running on without using an additional module, such as cluster,[36] StrongLoop Process Manager,[58] or pm2.[59] However, developers can increase the default number of threads in the libuv thread pool. The server operating system (OS) is likely to distribute these threads across multiple cores.[60] Another problem is that long-lasting computations and other CPU-bound tasks freeze the entire event-loop until completion.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eV8 is the JavaScript execution engine which was initially built for Google Chrome. It was then open-sourced by Google in 2008. Written in C++, V8 compiles JavaScript source code to native machine code at runtime.[7] As of 2016, it also includes Ignition, a bytecode interpreter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enpm is the pre-installed package manager for the Node.js server platform. It installs Node.js programs from the npm registry, organizing the installation and management of third-party Node.js programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNode.js registers with the operating system so the OS notifies it of asynchronous I/O events such as new connections. Within the Node.js runtime, events trigger callbacks and each connection is handled as a small heap allocation. Traditionally, relatively heavyweight OS processes or threads handled each connection. Node.js uses an event loop for concurrent I/O, instead of processes or threads.[61] In contrast to other event-driven servers,[which?] Node.js\u0027s event loop does not need to be called explicitly. Instead, callbacks are defined, and the server automatically enters the event loop at the end of the callback definition. Node.js exits the event loop when there are no further callbacks to be performed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNode.js supports WebAssembly and as of Node 14 has experimental support of WASI, the WebAssembly System Interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNode.js provides a way to create \"add-ons\" via a C-based API called N-API, which can be used to produce loadable (importable) .node modules from source code written in C/C++.[62] The modules can be directly loaded into memory and executed from within JS environment as simple CommonJS modules. The implementation of the N-API relies on internal C/C++ Node.js and V8 objects requiring users to import (#include) Node.js specific headers into their native source code.[62]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Node.js API is subject to breaking changes at a binary level, modules have to be built and shipped against specific Node.js versions to work properly. To address the issue, third parties have introduced open-sourced Ð¡/Ð¡++ wrappers on top of the API that partially alleviate the problem. They simplify interfaces, but as a side effect they may also introduce complexity which maintainers have to deal with. Even though the core functionality of Node.js resides in a JavaScript built-in library, modules written in C++ can be used to enhance capabilities and to improve performance of applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to produce such modules one needs to have an appropriate C++ compiler and necessary headers (the latter are typically shipped with Node.js itself), e.g., gcc, clang or MSVC++.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe N-API is similar to Java Native Interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, various branches of the greater Node.js community began working under the vendor-neutral Node.js Foundation. The stated purpose of the organization \"is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of Node.js and other related modules through an open governance model that encourages participation, technical contribution, and a framework for long-term stewardship by an ecosystem invested in Node.js\u0027 success.\"[63]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of the Node.js Foundation. The TSC is responsible for the core Node.js repo as well as dependent and adjacent projects.

Other current groups include Website, Streams, Build, Diagnostics, i18n, Evangelism, Docker, Addon API, Benchmarking, Post-mortem, Intl, Documentation, and Testing.[65]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn August 2017, a third of the TSC members resigned due to a dispute related to the project\u0027s code of conduct.[66]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2","html":""},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Studio","html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndroid Studio is the official[7] integrated development environment (IDE) for Google\u0027s Android operating system, built on JetBrains\u0027 IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development.[8] It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems.[9] It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools (E-ADT) as the primary IDE for native Android application development.

MongoDB offers support for many programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Python, Ruby and Swift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB environments provide users with a server to create databases with MongoDB. MongoDB stores data as records that are made up of collections and documents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocuments contain the data the user wants to store in the MongoDB database. Documents are composed of field and value pairs. They are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. The documents are similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) but use a variant called Binary JSON (BSON). The benefit of using BSON is that it accommodates more data types. The fields in these documents are like the columns in a relational database. Values contained can be a variety of data types, including other documents, arrays and arrays of documents, according to the MongoDB user manual. Documents will also incorporate a primary key as a unique identifier. A document\u0027s structure is changed by adding or deleting new or existing fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSets of documents are called collections, which function as the equivalent of relational database tables. Collections can contain any type of data, but the restriction is the data in a collection cannot be spread across different databases. Users of MongoDB can create multiple databases with multiple collections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mongo shell is a standard component of the open-source distributions of MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users connect the mongo shell to their running MongoDB instances. The mongo shell acts as an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB, which allows users to query or update data and conduct administrative operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA binary representation of JSON-like documents is provided by the BSON document storage and data interchange format. Automatic sharding is another key feature that enables data in a MongoDB collection to be distributed across multiple systems for horizontal scalability, as data volumes and throughput requirements increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NoSQL DBMS uses a single master architecture for data consistency, with secondary databases that maintain copies of the primary database. Operations are automatically replicated to those secondary databases for automatic failover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn organization might want to use MongoDB for the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeatures of MongoDB include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB offers several potential benefits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough there are some valuable benefits to MongoDB, there are some downsides to it as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of programs and capabilities that let IT teams and others create, update, administer and otherwise interact with a relational database. RDBMSes store data in the form of tables and rows. Although it is not necessary, RDBMS most commonly uses SQL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the main differences between MongoDB and RDBMS is that RDBMS is a relational database while MongoDB is nonrelational. Likewise, while most RDBMS systems use SQL to manage stored data, MongoDB uses BSON for data storage -- a type of NoSQL database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile RDBMS uses tables and rows, MongoDB uses documents and collections. In RDBMS a table -- the equivalent to a MongoDB collection -- stores data as columns and rows. Likewise, a row in RDBMS is the equivalent of a MongoDB document but stores data as structured data items in a table. A column denotes sets of data values, which is the equivalent to a field in MongoDB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB is also better suited for hierarchical storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB is available in community and commercial versions through vendor MongoDB Inc. MongoDB Community Edition is the open source release, while MongoDB Enterprise Server brings added security features, an in-memory storage engine, administration and authentication features, and monitoring capabilities through Ops Manager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA graphical user interface (GUI) named MongoDB Compass gives users a way to work with document structure, conduct queries, index data and more. The MongoDB Connector for BI lets users connect the NoSQL database to their business intelligence tools to visualize data and create reports using SQL queries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing in the footsteps of other NoSQL database providers, MongoDB Inc. launched a cloud database as a service named MongoDB Atlas in 2016. Atlas runs on AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. Later, MongoDB released a platform named Stitch for application development on MongoDB Atlas, with plans to extend it to on-premises databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe company also added support for multi-document atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) transactions as part of MongoDB 4.0 in 2018. Complying with the ACID properties across multiple documents expands the types of transactional workloads that MongoDB can handle with guaranteed accuracy and reliability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB was created by Dwight Merriman and Eliot Horowitz, who encountered development and scalability issues with traditional relational database approaches while building web applications at DoubleClick, an online advertising company that is now owned by Google Inc. The name of the database was derived from the word humongous to represent the idea of supporting large amounts of data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerriman and Horowitz helped form 10Gen Inc. in 2007 to commercialize MongoDB and related software. The company was renamed MongoDB Inc. in 2013 and went public in October 2017 under the ticker symbol MDB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe DBMS was released as open source software in 2009 and has been kept updated since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizations like the insurance company MetLife have used MongoDB for customer service applications, while other websites like Craigslist have used it for archiving data.

Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables with pre-defined schemas to store data, NoSQL databases use flexible data models that can adapt to changes in data structures and are capable of scaling horizontally to handle growing amounts of data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe term NoSQL originally referred to ânon-SQLâ or ânon-relationalâ databases, but the term has since evolved to mean ânot only SQL,â as NoSQL databases have expanded to include a wide range of different database architectures and data models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoSQL databases are often used in applications where there is a high volume of data that needs to be processed and analyzed in real-time, such as social media analytics, e-commerce, and gaming. They can also be used for other applications, such as content management systems, document management, and customer relationship management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, NoSQL databases may not be suitable for all applications, as they may not provide the same level of data consistency and transactional guarantees as traditional relational databases. It is important to carefully evaluate the specific needs of an application when choosing a database management system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoSQL originally referring to non SQL or non relational is a database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. This data is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases came into existence in the late 1960s, but did not obtain the NoSQL moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first century. NoSQL databases are used in real-time web applications and big data and their use are increasing over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKey Features of NoSQL:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvantages of NoSQL: There are many advantages of working with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra.

And this goes not only for large companies, but for independent developers as well. In fact, containers played a vital role in the development and deployment of our project SpaceCraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, weâre going to give an introduction to containers and explain their core features. Weâll then showcase their uses in software development and cover some important topics regarding security and resource management. Along the way, weâll give a peek into how containers were utilized in SpaceCraft. Letâs dive in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what exactly is a container?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt its core, a container can be described as a single unit of encapsulated software. Itâs essentially a box in which you can place all of your project dependencies and run a single service or an entire development environment, while keeping everything inside the box isolated from the host system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, imagine that you need to work on a new project and know all of the needed dependencies. But some of these dependencies may conflict with what you already have installed on your computer, like a language version number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you were to work on the project on your computer, youâd have to go through the tedious process of managing your dependencies and deactivating versions while activating the versions that you need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis issue is compounded when itâs a whole team of developers working on the same project, and no two developers have the same configurations on their computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a container, you can simply put all your needed dependencies inside it and then work on your project from within the container. This saves a ton of a headache by eliminating the dependency management issues and instead providing us with an isolated area to work in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we now know what a container is. But how exactly do we create them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, to start we need to create an image. This is simply a package that includes all of the dependencies that should exist in our container. Itâs a snapshot of everything that should be inside our container when we run it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn easy way to visualize this is to think of an image as a class and a container as an object that is instantiated from that class. So our image will serve as a blueprint for creating our containers, and we can create any number of identical containers from the same image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImages are built by executing a set of commands. In Docker, the set of commands are written in a text file called Dockerfile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the image build process starts, each command forms a layer that comprises the final image. The last layer specifies what command to run within a container when a container is started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn SpaceCraft, we bundled a modified version of Ubuntu, our language runtimes, and a copy of our application code into an image to start multiple containers that each run an instance of our application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImages do not necessarily need to be stored or built on just your local machine. Containers are meant to be deployable anywhere and thus we should be able to access our images from any physical machine. This is accomplished through registries, which are essentially a place to remotely store and access images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we can dive into the many use cases of containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember how we said that containers can provide us with an isolated box to hold a development environment with a specific set of dependencies? Each developer can simply download the needed image from a registry onto their local computer and then create a container from that image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis way, they can start contributing to existing projects in no time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, one of the biggest advantages of containers is that they are easily deployable on a variety of systems, due to their isolation. This allows developers to uncouple their software from their physical machines and launch a container from anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother use case involves placing a single service in a container and then communicating with that service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this situation, you can build a system that houses individual services in separate containers. This allows you to isolate each piece of your system architecture and run multiple services on the same host while making it easy to swap services in and out of your system as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo demonstrate how this works, each service can communicate with each other through Docker container networking by their IP addresses. With this, containers can, for instance, send HTTP requests with the destination containerâs IP address as part of the URL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, we use this technique in SpaceCraft. Weâve built a reverse proxy server that forwards clientsâ requests to the appropriate containers. To enable communication between our reverse proxy server and the containers, we retrieve the containersâ IP addresses during initialization and use them as destinations for proxying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother important use case is that containerized applications are isolated from the host system. This prevents unwanted user access to the hostâs file system. This is important, especially for an application like SpaceCraft that gives users the ability to execute code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can also add security measures to strengthen the isolation and further prevent malicious activity from reaching our host system. Weâll explore these strategies in the following section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, we want to make clear the distinction between containers and virtual machines, as this can heavily impact your decision on which to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVirtual machines came before containers, and were used to address the same pain points as containers. Essentially, they provide an isolated environment for services and development and are deployable on multiple systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there are some significant differences between them and containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, containers are more lightweight in memory requirements than virtual machines. Depending on what you place in a container, they generally run in the tens to hundreds of MBs for memory size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVirtual machines are far heavier and run into the GBs. This is mainly due to one big inclusion: the operating system kernel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVirtual machines contain not only all of your dependencies for your service or environment, but also a full copy of an operating system kernel to run all of your dependencies. This addition can add a lot of memory to an instance of a virtual machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, containers donât contain a kernel and instead make system calls to the host system kernel. This dramatically lowers their memory footprint. It allows for more containers to be created and used on a system, as opposed to the number of virtual machines you can run on the same system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to a smaller memory footprint, the lack of a kernel in a container makes their startup time a lot faster. Container startup can happen in seconds, whereas virtual machines will take much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there are always tradeoffs. When it comes to virtual machines versus containers, the big tradeoff is security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause containers need access to the host system kernel to make system calls, they are not as airtight on security as a virtual machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, resourceful malicious users can find ways to use this security disadvantage to break out of a container and gain access to the host system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith virtual machines, this risk is mitigated because each instance of a virtual machine contains a kernel for its system calls. Thus there is stronger isolation between a virtual machine and the host system than with a container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the security risks of containers can be addressed by implementing a few security measures that we incorporated into SpaceCraft, which we will look at now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne huge security issue that you should know about is that users generally run as root users in containers by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that anyone who works inside a container, whether a developer on your team or a user who is using an application that is housed in a container on the back end, will have privileged access to the container file system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf youâre concerned about giving this level of control over to the container user, then you should consider ways to limit their privileges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis issue can be addressed by creating an unprivileged user profile in the container filesystem, and having users run as that user profile while in the container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will restrict their ability to access the container filesystem and run commands that could harm your container environment and any services running inside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother security issue that can rear its head is the ability for users to break out of containers and access the file system of the host system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we mentioned before, containers make system calls to the host system kernel in order to run processes. This opens the door for malicious users to break out of a container and attach the host system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the methods we use to prevent this situation is to use a container runtime sandbox to intercept the system calls made by a container. The sandbox acts as a guest kernel and creates a strong level of isolation between the container and host kernel. This prevents malicious users from attacking our host system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf youâre interested in using a container runtime sandbox, check out gVisor which is an open-source solution provided by Google that we utilized with SpaceCraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more issue that we want to address pertains to potential abuse of a containerâs resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince a container runs on a host system and uses the host kernel, it essentially consumes CPU and memory resources from the host system to complete its processes and tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this is usually not a problem on an individual level with developers using containers, it does become a bigger problem once we use containers to deploy applications to be used by external users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetâs say that your system architecture includes using containers to run separate instances of your application that users can access. And something happens with one of those containerized instances that requires more CPU and memory from the host system than expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat this can result in is that one instance hogs system resources away from the other instances which causes their performances to drop and create a poor user experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, this is a situation that we want to avoid if possible. Thankfully we can do so with cgroups, which is short for âcontrol groupsâ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith cgroups, you can limit the amount of system resources used by a container and thereby prevent the situation we just described.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, you can set the cgroups on a container to be a maximum of 100MB of memory and 20% of CPU. With those limits set, that container will never be able to use more than 100MB of memory or utilize more than 20% of CPU from the host system for its lifetime. You can rest easy knowing that the performance of your other containerized application instances will not drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn SpaceCraft, we utilized cgroups to limit the maximum amount of memory and CPU that a single session can consume. If a session happens to run an expensive computation and consume all available resource within that container, only that session will be affected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many container services that you can choose from.

It can be used to power performance-critical services while guaranteeing memory-safety and thread-safety, empowering developers to debug at compile-time. In addition to that Rust has great documentation and a user-friendly compiler with top-end tools like integrated package managers and multi-editor with features like type inspection and auto-completion. Rust prevents all the crashes, and it is very interesting that rust is safe by default like JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. This is much more powerful than C/C++ because we cannot write the wrong parallel code you can never see fault in rust.

The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.[5]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,[6] while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.[7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.[8]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData structures can be implemented using a variety of programming languages and techniques, but they all share the common goal of efficiently organizing and storing data.[9] Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointerâa bit string, representing a memory address, that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, the array and record data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations, while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself. This approach to data structuring has profound implications for the efficiency and scalability of algorithms. For instance, the contiguous memory allocation in arrays facilitates rapid access and modification operations, leading to optimized performance in sequential data processing scenarios.[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an abstract data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical properties of those operations (including their space and time cost).[11]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are numerous types of data structures, generally built upon simpler primitive data types. Well known examples are:[12]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost assembly languages and some low-level languages, such as BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language), lack built-in support for data structures. On the other hand, many high-level programming languages and some higher-level assembly languages, such as MASM, have special syntax or other built-in support for certain data structures, such as records and arrays. For example, the C (a direct descendant of BCPL) and Pascal languages support structs and records, respectively, in addition to vectors (one-dimensional arrays) and multi-dimensional arrays.[14][15]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost programming languages feature some sort of library mechanism that allows data structure implementations to be reused by different programs. Modern languages usually come with standard libraries that implement the most common data structures. Examples are the C++ Standard Template Library, the Java Collections Framework, and the Microsoft .NET Framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModern languages also generally support modular programming, the separation between the interface of a library module and its implementation. Some provide opaque data types that allow clients to hide implementation details. Object-oriented programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Smalltalk, typically use classes for this purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany known data structures have concurrent versions which allow multiple computing threads to access a single concrete instance of a data structure simultaneously.[16]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-assembly-language/","html":"\u003cp\u003eWhen we talk about programming languages the first thing that comes to our mind is languages like C, C++, Java, Python etc. But those languages hide the actual working i.e., that abstracts many things from users. But there is a language that really lies on basic concepts behind the programming or interaction between computer hardware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly language is a low-level language that helps to communicate directly with computer hardware. It uses mnemonics to represent the operations that a processor has to do. Which is an intermediate language between high-level languages like C++ and the binary language. It uses hexadecimal and binary values, and it is readable by humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssembly languages contain mnemonic codes that specify what the processor should do. The mnemonic code that was written by the programmer was converted into machine language (binary language) for execution. An assembler is used to convert assembly code into machine language. That machine code is stored in an executable file for the sake of execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt enables the programmer to communicate directly with the hardware such as registers, memory locations, input/output devices or any other hardware components.

It also increased the build efficiency and improved the scalability of the hot-module replacement feature.[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVersion 7.0 was released in September 2018 with improved error handling and support for React\u0027s context API for improved dynamic route handling.

This major release brought about a new routing pattern in beta, with the addition of the App Router that includes support for layouts, React Server Components, streaming, and a new set of data fetching methods. Furthermore, Vercel announced a new toolchain for front-end development called Turbo, including Turbopack as a successor to Webpack, Turborepo for incremental build systems.[24]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn May 2023, Vercel released Next.js 13.4.

Which comes with improve memory management with using edge runtime.[26]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext.js supports styling with CSS as well as precompiled Scss and Sass, CSS-in-JS, and styled JSX.[13] In addition, it is built with TypeScript support and smart bundling.[27] The open-source transpiler SWC is used to transform and compile code into JavaScript usable by a browser.[28] Webpack, another open-source tool, is used to bundle the modules afterward, however it is currently being replaced with TurboPack.[29] All of these tools are used with npm in a terminal.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main feature of Next.js is its use of server-side rendering to reduce the burden on web browsers and provide enhanced security[citation needed]. This can be done for any part of the application or the entire system, allowing for content-rich pages to be singled out for server-side rendering.[10] It can also be done only for first-time visitors, to reduce the burden on web browsers that have yet to download any of the site\u0027s assets.[11] The \"hot reloading\" feature detects changes as they are made and re-renders the appropriate pages so the server avoids the need to be restarted. This allows changes made to the application code to be immediately reflected in the web browser, though some browsers will require the page to be refreshed.[10] The software uses page-based routing for developer convenience and includes support for dynamic routing. Other features include hot-module replacement so that modules can be replaced live, automatic code splitting, which only includes code necessary to load the page, and page prefetching to reduce load time.[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext.js also supports Incremental Static Regeneration[30] and static site generation - a compiled version of the website is usually built during build time and saved as a .next folder. When a user makes a request, the pre-built version which are static HTML pages are cached and sent to them. This makes the load time very fast, but it\u0027s not suitable for every website, particularly for interactive sites that change often and utilize a lot of user input.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://github.com/vim/vim","html":"\u003cp\u003eWe read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo see all available qualifiers, see our documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe official Vim repository\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you find a bug or want to discuss the best way to add a new feature, please open an issue.

It is popular for systems programming.[13][14][15]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftware developer Graydon Hoare created Rust as a personal project while working at Mozilla Research in 2006. Mozilla officially sponsored the project in 2009. In the years following the first stable release in May 2015, Rust was adopted by companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Google (Alphabet), Meta, and Microsoft. In December 2022, it became the first language other than C and assembly to be supported in the development of the Linux kernel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust has been noted for its rapid adoption,[16] and has been studied in programming language theory research.[17][18][19]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust began as a personal project in 2006 by Mozilla Research employee Graydon Hoare.[20] Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009 as a part of the ongoing development of an experimental browser engine called Servo,[21] which was officially announced by Mozilla in 2010.[22][23] Rust\u0027s memory and ownership system was influenced by region-based memory management in languages such as Cyclone and ML Kit.[5]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround the same time, work shifted from the initial compiler written in OCaml to a self-hosting compiler based on LLVM written in Rust. The new Rust compiler successfully compiled itself in 2011.[21][better source needed] In the fall of 2011, the Rust logo was developed based on a bicycle chainring.[24]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust\u0027s type system underwent significant changes between versions 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4. In version 0.2, which was released in March 2012, classes were introduced for the first time.[25] Four months later, version 0.3 added destructors and polymorphism, through the use of interfaces.[26] In October 2012, version 0.4 was released, which added traits as a means of inheritance. Interfaces were combined with traits and removed as a separate feature; and classes were replaced by a combination of implementations and structured types.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the early 2010s, memory management through the ownership system was gradually consolidated to prevent memory bugs. By 2013, Rust\u0027s garbage collector was removed, with the ownership rules in place.[20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January 2014, the editor-in-chief of Dr. Dobb\u0027s Journal, Andrew Binstock, commented on Rust\u0027s chances of becoming a competitor to C++, along with D, Go, and Nim (then Nimrod). According to Binstock, while Rust was \"widely viewed as a remarkably elegant language\", adoption slowed because it radically changed from version to version.[28] The first stable release, Rust 1.0, was released on May 15, 2015.[29][30]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe development of the Servo browser engine continued alongside Rust\u0027s own growth. In September 2017, Firefox 57 was released as the first version that incorporated components from Servo, in a project named \"Firefox Quantum\".[31]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn August 2020, Mozilla laid off 250 of its 1,000 employees worldwide, as part of a corporate restructuring caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[32][33] The team behind Servo was disbanded. The event raised concerns about the future of Rust, as some members of the team were active contributors to Rust.[34] In the following week, the Rust Core Team acknowledged the severe impact of the layoffs and announced that plans for a Rust foundation were underway. The first goal of the foundation would be to take ownership of all trademarks and domain names, and take financial responsibility for their costs.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 8, 2021, the formation of the Rust Foundation was announced by its five founding companies (AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla).[36][37] In a blog post published on April 6, 2021, Google announced support for Rust within the Android Open Source Project as an alternative to C/C++.[38]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn November 22, 2021, the Moderation Team, which was responsible for enforcing community standards and the Code of Conduct, announced their resignation \"in protest of the Core Team placing themselves unaccountable to anyone but themselves\".[39] In May 2022, the Rust Core Team, other lead programmers, and certain members of the Rust Foundation board implemented governance reforms in response to the incident.[40]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rust Foundation posted a draft for a new trademark policy on April 6, 2023, revising its rules on how the Rust logo and name can be used, which resulted in negative reactions from Rust users and contributors.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust\u0027s syntax is similar to that of C and C++,[42][43] although many of its features were influenced by functional programming languages.[44] Hoare described Rust as targeted at \"frustrated C++ developers\" and emphasized features such as safety, control of memory layout, and concurrency.[21] Safety in Rust includes the guarantees of memory safety, type safety, and lack of data races.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow is a \"Hello, World!\" program in Rust. The fn keyword denotes a function, and the println! macro prints the message to standard output.[45] Statements in Rust are separated by semicolons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Rust, blocks of code are delimited by curly brackets, and control flow is implemented by keywords including if, else, while, and for.[46] Pattern matching can be done using the match keyword.[47] In the examples below, explanations are given in comments, which start with //.[48]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust is expression-oriented, with nearly every part of a function body being an expression, including control-flow operators.[49] The ordinary if expression is used instead of C\u0027s ternary conditional. With returns being implicit, a function does not need to end with a return expression; if the semicolon is omitted, the value of the last expression in the function is used as the return value,[50] as seen in the following recursive implementation of the factorial function:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following iterative implementation uses the ..\u003d operator to create an inclusive range:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Rust, anonymous functions are called closures.[51] They are defined using the following syntax:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith type inference, however, the compiler is able to infer the type of each parameter and the return type, so the above form can be written as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith closures with a single expression (i.e. a body with one line) and implicit return type, the curly braces may be omitted:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosures with no input parameter are written like so:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosures may be passed as input parameters of functions that expect a function pointer:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, one may need complex rules to describe how values in the body of the closure are captured. They are implemented using the Fn, FnMut, and FnOnce traits:[52]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith these traits, the compiler will capture variables in the least restrictive manner possible.[52] They help govern how values are moved around between scopes, which is largely important since Rust follows a lifetime construct to ensure values are \"borrowed\" and moved in a predictable and explicit manner.[53]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following demonstrates how one may pass a closure as an input parameter using the Fn trait:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe previous function definition can also be shortened for convenience as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust is strongly typed and statically typed. The types of all variables must be known at compilation time; assigning a value of a particular type to a differently typed variable causes a compilation error. Variables are declared with the keyword let, and type inference is used to determine their type.[54] Variables assigned multiple times must be marked with the keyword mut (short for mutable).[55]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe default integer type is i32, and the default floating point type is f64. If the type of a literal number is not explicitly provided, either it is inferred from the context or the default type is used.[56]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOption values are handled using syntactic sugar, such as the if let construction, to access the inner value (in this case, a string):[76]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(or possibly null pointer if wrapped in option)[65]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust does not use null pointers to indicate a lack of data, as doing so can lead to null dereferencing. Accordingly, the basic \u0026 and \u0026mut references are guaranteed to not be null. Rust instead uses Option for this purpose: Some(T) indicates that a value is present, and None is analogous to the null pointer.[77] Option implements a \"null pointer optimization\", avoiding any spatial overhead for types that cannot have a null value (references or the NonZero types, for example).[78]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike references, the raw pointer types *const and *mut may be null; however, it is impossible to dereference them unless the code is explicitly declared unsafe through the use of an unsafe block. Unlike dereferencing, the creation of raw pointers is allowed inside of safe Rust code.[79]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUser-defined types are created with the struct or enum keywords. The struct keyword is used to denote a record type that groups multiple related values.[80] enums can take on different variants at runtime, with its capabilities similar to algebraic data types found in functional programming languages.[81] Both structs and enums can contain fields with different types.[82] Alternative names for the same type can be defined with the type keyword.[83]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impl keyword can define methods for a user-defined type. Data and functions are defined separately. Implementations fulfill a role similar to that of classes within other languages.[84]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust provides no implicit type conversion (coercion) between primitive types. But, explicit type conversion (casting) can be performed using the as keyword.[85]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust\u0027s ownership system consists of rules that ensure memory safety without using a garbage collector. At compile time, each value must be attached to a variable called the owner of that value, and every value must have exactly one owner.[86] Values are moved between different owners through assignment or passing a value as a function parameter. Values can also be borrowed, meaning they are temporarily passed to a different function before being returned to the owner.[87] With these rules, Rust can prevent the creation and use of dangling pointers:[87][88]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of these ownership rules, Rust types are known as linear or affine types, meaning each value can be used exactly once. This enforces a form of software fault isolation as the owner of a value is solely responsible for its correctness and deallocation.[89]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a value goes out of scope, it is dropped by running its destructor. The destructor may be programmatically defined through implementing the Drop trait. This helps manage resources such as file handles, network sockets, and locks, since when objects are dropped, the resources associated with them are closed or released automatically.[90]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifetimes are usually an implicit part of all reference types in Rust. Each lifetime encompasses a set of locations in the code for which a variable is valid. For example, a reference to a local variable has a lifetime corresponding to the block it is defined in:[91]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe borrow checker in the Rust compiler uses lifetimes to ensure that the values a reference points to remain valid.[92][93] In the example above, storing a reference to variable x to r is valid, as variable x has a longer lifetime (\u0027a) than variable r (\u0027b). However, when x has a shorter lifetime, the borrow checker would reject the program:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the lifetime of the referenced variable (\u0027b) is shorter than the lifetime of the variable holding the reference (\u0027a), the borrow checker errors, preventing x from being used from outside its scope.[94]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust defines the relationship between the lifetimes of the objects created and used by functions, using lifetime parameters, as a signature feature.[95]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe example below parses some configuration options from a string and creates a struct containing the options. The struct only contains references to the data; so, for the struct to remain valid, the data referred to by the struct must be valid as well. The function signature for parse_config specifies this relationship explicitly. In this example, the explicit lifetimes are unnecessary in newer Rust versions, due to lifetime elision, which is an algorithm that automatically assigns lifetimes to functions if they are trivial.[96]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust is designed to be memory safe. It does not permit null pointers, dangling pointers, or data races.[97][98][99] Data values can be initialized only through a fixed set of forms, all of which require their inputs to be already initialized.[100]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsafe code can subvert some of these restrictions, using the unsafe keyword.[79] Unsafe code may also be used for low-level functionality, such as volatile memory access, architecture-specific intrinsics, type punning, and inline assembly.[101]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust does not use garbage collection. Memory and other resources are instead managed through the \"resource acquisition is initialization\" convention,[102] with optional reference counting. Rust provides deterministic management of resources, with very low overhead.[103] Values are allocated on the stack by default, and all dynamic allocations must be explicit.[104]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe built-in reference types using the \u0026 symbol do not involve run-time reference counting. The safety and validity of the underlying pointers is verified at compile time, preventing dangling pointers and other forms of undefined behavior.[105] Rust\u0027s type system separates shared, immutable references of the form \u0026T from unique, mutable references of the form \u0026mut T. A mutable reference can be coerced to an immutable reference, but not vice versa.[106]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust\u0027s more advanced features include the use of generic functions. A generic function is given generic parameters, which allow the same function to be applied to different variable types. This capability reduces duplicate code[107] and is known as parametric polymorphism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following program calculates the sum of two things, for which addition is implemented using a generic function:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt compile time, polymorphic functions like sum are instantiated with the specific types the code requires; in this case, sum of integers and sum of floats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerics can be used in functions to allow implementing a behavior for different types without repeating the same code. Generic functions can be written in relation to other generics, without knowing the actual type.[108]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust\u0027s type system supports a mechanism called traits, inspired by type classes in the Haskell language,[5] to define shared behavior between different types. For example, the Add trait can be implemented for floats and integers, which can be added; and the Display or Debug traits can be implemented for any type that can be converted to a string. Traits can be used to provide a set of common behavior for different types without knowing the actual type. This facility is known as ad hoc polymorphism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneric functions can constrain the generic type to implement a particular trait or traits; for example, an add_one function might require the type to implement Add. This means that a generic function can be type-checked as soon as it is defined. The implementation of generics is similar to the typical implementation of C++ templates: a separate copy of the code is generated for each instantiation. This is called monomorphization and contrasts with the type erasure scheme typically used in Java and Haskell. Type erasure is also available via the keyword dyn (short for dynamic).[109] Because monomorphization duplicates the code for each type used, it can result in more optimized code for specific-use cases, but compile time and size of the output binary are also increased.[110]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to defining methods for a user-defined type, the impl keyword can be used to implement a trait for a type.[84] Traits can provide additional derived methods when implemented.[111] For example, the trait Iterator requires that the next method be defined for the type. Once the next method is defined, the trait can provide common functional helper methods over the iterator, such as map or filter.[112]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust traits are implemented using static dispatch, meaning that the type of all values is known at compile time; however, Rust also uses a feature known as trait objects to accomplish dynamic dispatch (also known as duck typing).[113] Dynamically dispatched trait objects are declared using the syntax dyn Tr where Tr is a trait. Trait objects are dynamically sized, therefore they must be put behind a pointer, such as Box.[114] The following example creates a list of objects where each object can be printed out using the Display trait:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf an element in the list does not implement the Display trait, it will cause a compile-time error.[115]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor loops in Rust work in a functional style as operations over an iterator type. For example, in the loop\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0..100 is a value of type Range which implements the Iterator trait; the code applies the function f to each element returned by the iterator. Iterators can be combined with functions over iterators like map, filter, and sum. For example, the following adds up all numbers between 1 and 100 that are multiples of 3:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is possible to extend the Rust language using macros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA declarative macro (also called a \"macro by example\") is a macro that uses pattern matching to determine its expansion.[116][117]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProcedural macros are Rust functions that run and modify the compiler\u0027s input token stream, before any other components are compiled. They are generally more flexible than declarative macros, but are more difficult to maintain due to their complexity.[118][119]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProcedural macros come in three flavors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe println! macro is an example of a function-like macro. Theserde_derive macro[120] provides a commonly used library for generating code for reading and writing data in many formats, such as JSON. Attribute macros are commonly used for language bindings, such as the extendr library for Rust bindings to R.[121]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following code shows the use of the Serialize, Deserialize, and Debug-derived procedural macros to implement JSON reading and writing, as well as the ability to format a structure for debugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust does not support variadic arguments in functions. Instead, it uses macros.[122]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust has a foreign function interface (FFI) that can be used both to call code written in languages such as C from Rust and to call Rust code from those languages. As of 2023, an external library called CXX exists for calling to or from C++.[124] Rust and C differ in how they lay out structs in memory, so Rust structs may be given a #[repr(C)] attribute, forcing the same layout as the equivalent C struct.[125]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rust ecosystem includes its compiler, its standard library, and additional components for software development. Component installation is typically managed by rustup, a Rust toolchain installer developed by the Rust project.[126]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rust compiler is named rustc, and translates Rust code into a low level language called LLVM intermediate representation (LLVM IR). LLVM is then invoked as a subcomponent to translate IR code into machine code. A linker is then used to combine multiple crates together as a single executable or binary file.[127][128]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than LLVM, the compiler also supports using alternative backends such as GCC and Cranelift for code generation.[129] The intention of those alternative backends is to increase platform coverage of Rust or to improve compilation times.[130][131]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rust standard library defines and implements many widely used custom data types, including core data structures such as Vec, Option, and HashMap, as well as smart pointer types. Rust also provides a way to exclude most of the standard library using the attribute #![no_std]; this enables applications, such as embedded devices, which want to remove dependency code or provide their own core data structures. Internally, the standard library is divided into three parts, core, alloc, and std, where std and alloc are excluded by #![no_std].[132]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCargo is Rust\u0027s build system and package manager. It downloads, compiles, distributes, and uploads packagesâcalled cratesâthat are maintained in an official registry. It also acts as a front-end for Clippy and other Rust components.[16]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy default, Cargo sources its dependencies from the user-contributed registry crates.io, but Git repositories and crates in the local filesystem, and other external sources can also be specified as dependencies.[133]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRustfmt is a code formatter for Rust. It formats whitespace and indentation to produce code in accordance with a common style, unless otherwise specified. It can be invoked as a standalone program, or from a Rust project through Cargo.[134]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClippy is Rust\u0027s built-in linting tool to improve the correctness, performance, and readability of Rust code. As of 2024[update], it has more than 700 rules.[135][136]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing Rust 1.0, new features are developed in nightly versions which are released daily. During each six-week release cycle, changes to nightly versions are released to beta, while changes from the previous beta version are released to a new stable version.[137]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery two or three years, a new \"edition\" is produced. Editions are released to allow making limited breaking changes, such as promoting await to a keyword to support async/await features. Crates targeting different editions can interoperate with each other, so a crate can upgrade to a new edition even if its callers or its dependencies still target older editions. Migration to a new edition can be assisted with automated tooling.[138]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most popular language server for Rust is Rust Analyzer, which officially replaced the original language server, RLS, in July 2022.[139] Rust Analyzer provides IDEs and text editors with information about a Rust project; basic features including autocompletion, and the display of compilation errors while editing.[140]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, Rust\u0027s memory safety guarantees do not impose a runtime overhead.[141] A notable exception is array indexing which is checked at runtime, though this often does not impact performance.[142] Since it does not perform garbage collection, Rust is often faster than other memory-safe languages.[143][144][145]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust provides two \"modes\": safe and unsafe. Safe mode is the \"normal\" one, in which most Rust is written. In unsafe mode, the developer is responsible for the code\u0027s memory safety, which is useful for cases where the compiler is too restrictive.[146]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of Rust\u0027s features are so-called zero-cost abstractions, meaning they are optimized away at compile time and incur no runtime penalty.[147] The ownership and borrowing system permits zero-copy implementations for some performance-sensitive tasks, such as parsing.[148] Static dispatch is used by default to eliminate method calls, with the exception of methods called on dynamic trait objects.[149] The compiler also uses inline expansion to eliminate function calls and statically-dispatched method invocations.[150]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Rust utilizes LLVM, any performance improvements in LLVM also carry over to Rust.[151] Unlike C and C++, Rust allows for reordering struct and enum elements[152] to reduce the sizes of structures in memory, for better memory alignment, and to improve cache access efficiency.[153]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust has been used in software across different domains. Rust was initially funded by Mozilla as part of developing Servo, an experimental parallel browser engine, in collaboration with Samsung.[154] Components from the Servo engine were later incorporated in the Gecko browser engine underlying Firefox.[155] In January 2023, Google (Alphabet) announced support for third party Rust libraries in Chromium and consequently in the ChromeOS code base.[156]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust is used in several backend software projects of large web services. OpenDNS, a DNS resolution service owned by Cisco, uses Rust internally.[157][158] Amazon Web Services began developing projects in Rust as early as 2017,[159] including Firecracker, a virtualization solution;[160] Bottlerocket, a Linux distribution and containerization solution;[161] and Tokio, an asynchronous networking stack.[162] Microsoft Azure IoT Edge, a platform used to run Azure services on IoT devices, has components implemented in Rust.[163] Microsoft also uses Rust to run containerized modules with WebAssembly and Kubernetes.[164] Cloudflare, a company providing content delivery network services uses Rust for its firewall pattern matching engine and the Pingora web server.[165][166]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn operating systems, Rust support has been added to Linux[167][168] and Android.[169][170] Microsoft is rewriting parts of Windows in Rust.[171] The r9 project aims to re-implement Plan 9 from Bell Labs in Rust.[172] Rust has been used in the development of new operating systems such as Redox, a \"Unix-like\" operating system and microkernel,[173] Theseus, an experimental operating system with modular state management,[174][175] and most of Fuchsia.[176] Rust is also used for command-line tools and operating system components, including stratisd, a file system manager[177][178] and COSMIC, a desktop environment by System76.[179][180]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn web development, the npm package manager started using Rust in production in 2019.[181][182][183] Deno, a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, is built with V8, Rust, and Tokio.[184] Other notable adoptions in this space include Ruffle, an open-source SWF emulator,[185] and Polkadot, an open source blockchain and cryptocurrency platform.[186]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiscord, an instant messaging social platform uses Rust for portions of its backend, as well as client-side video encoding.[187] In 2021, Dropbox announced their use of Rust for a screen, video, and image capturing service.[188] Facebook (Meta) used Rust for Mononoke, a server for the Mercurial version control system.[189]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 13% of respondents had recently done extensive development in Rust.[190] The survey also named Rust the \"most loved programming language\" every year from 2016 to 2023 (inclusive), based on the number of developers interested in continuing to work in the same language.[191][note 8] In 2023, Rust was the 6th \"most wanted technology\", with 31% of developers not currently working in Rust expressing an interest in doing so.[190]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rust Foundation is a non-profit membership organization incorporated in United States, with the primary purposes of backing the technical project as a legal entity and helping to manage the trademark and infrastructure assets.[194][43]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was established on February 8, 2021, with five founding corporate members (Amazon Web Services, Huawei, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla).[195] The foundation\u0027s board is chaired by Shane Miller.[196] Starting in late 2021, its Executive Director and CEO is Rebecca Rumbul.[197] Prior to this, Ashley Williams was interim executive director.[198]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rust project is composed of teams that are responsible for different subareas of the development.

This alignment of three celestial objects is known as a syzygy.[1] An eclipse is the result of either an occultation (completely hidden) or a transit (partially hidden). A \"deep eclipse\" (or \"deep occultation\") is when a small astronomical object is behind a bigger one.[2][3]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe term eclipse is most often used to describe either a solar eclipse, when the Moon\u0027s shadow crosses the Earth\u0027s surface, or a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into the Earth\u0027s shadow. However, it can also refer to such events beyond the EarthâMoon system: for example, a planet moving into the shadow cast by one of its moons, a moon passing into the shadow cast by its host planet, or a moon passing into the shadow of another moon. A binary star system can also produce eclipses if the plane of the orbit of its constituent stars intersects the observer\u0027s position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the special cases of solar and lunar eclipses, these only happen during an \"eclipse season\", the two times of each year when the plane of the Earth\u0027s orbit around the Sun crosses with the plane of the Moon\u0027s orbit around the Earth and the line defined by the intersecting planes points near the Sun. The type of solar eclipse that happens during each season (whether total, annular, hybrid, or partial) depends on apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon. If the orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the Moon\u0027s orbit around the Earth were both in the same plane with each other, then eclipses would happen every month. There would be a lunar eclipse at every full moon, and a solar eclipse at every new moon. It is because of the non-planar differences that eclipses are not a common event. If both orbits were perfectly circular, then each eclipse would be the same type every month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunar eclipses can be viewed from the entire nightside half of the Earth. But solar eclipses, particularly total eclipses occurring at any one particular point on the Earth\u0027s surface, are very rare events that can be many decades apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe term is derived from the ancient Greek noun á¼ÎºÎ»ÎµÎ¹ÏÎ¹Ï (Ã©kleipsis), which means \u0027the abandonment\u0027, \u0027the downfall\u0027, or \u0027the darkening of a heavenly body\u0027, which is derived from the verb á¼ÎºÎ»ÎµÎ¯ÏÏ (ekleÃ­pÅ) which means \u0027to abandon\u0027, \u0027to darken\u0027, or \u0027to cease to exist\u0027,[4] a combination of prefix á¼Îº- (ek-), from preposition á¼Îº (ek), \u0027out\u0027, and of verb Î»ÎµÎ¯ÏÏ (leÃ­pÅ), \u0027to be absent\u0027.[5][6]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor any two objects in space, a line can be extended from the first through the second. The latter object will block some amount of light being emitted by the former, creating a region of shadow around the axis of the line. Typically these objects are moving with respect to each other and their surroundings, so the resulting shadow will sweep through a region of space, only passing through any particular location in the region for a fixed interval of time. As viewed from such a location, this shadowing event is known as an eclipse.[7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically the cross-section of the objects involved in an astronomical eclipse is roughly disk-shaped.[7] The region of an object\u0027s shadow during an eclipse is divided into three parts:[8]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA total eclipse occurs when the observer is within the umbra, an annular eclipse when the observer is within the antumbra, and a partial eclipse when the observer is within the penumbra. During a lunar eclipse only the umbra and penumbra are applicable, because the antumbra of the Sun-Earth system lies far beyond the Moon. Analogously, Earth\u0027s apparent diameter from the viewpoint of the Moon is nearly four times that of the Sun and thus cannot produce an annular eclipse. The same terms may be used analogously in describing other eclipses, e.g., the antumbra of Deimos crossing Mars, or Phobos entering Mars\u0027s penumbra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first contact occurs when the eclipsing object\u0027s disc first starts to impinge on the light source; second contact is when the disc moves completely within the light source; third contact when it starts to move out of the light; and fourth or last contact when it finally leaves the light source\u0027s disc entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor spherical bodies, when the occulting object is smaller than the star, the length (L) of the umbra\u0027s cone-shaped shadow is given by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere Rs is the radius of the star, Ro is the occulting object\u0027s radius, and r is the distance from the star to the occulting object. For Earth, on average L is equal to 1.384Ã106 km, which is much larger than the Moon\u0027s semimajor axis of 3.844Ã105 km. Hence the umbral cone of the Earth can completely envelop the Moon during a lunar eclipse.[9] If the occulting object has an atmosphere, however, some of the luminosity of the star can be refracted into the volume of the umbra. This occurs, for example, during an eclipse of the Moon by the Earthâproducing a faint, ruddy illumination of the Moon even at totality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Earth, the shadow cast during an eclipse moves very approximately at 1 km per sec. This depends on the location of the shadow on the Earth and the angle in which it is moving.[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn eclipse cycle takes place when eclipses in a series are separated by a certain interval of time. This happens when the orbital motions of the bodies form repeating harmonic patterns. A particular instance is the saros, which results in a repetition of a solar or lunar eclipse every 6,585.3 days, or a little over 18 years. Because this is not a whole number of days, successive eclipses will be visible from different parts of the world.[11] In one saros period there are 239.0 anomalistic periods, 241.0 sidereal periods, 242.0 nodical periods, and 223.0 synodic periods. Although the orbit of the Moon does not give exact integers, the numbers of orbit cycles are close enough to integers to give strong similarity for eclipses spaced at 18.03 yr intervals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn eclipse involving the Sun, Earth, and Moon can occur only when they are nearly in a straight line, allowing one to be hidden behind another, viewed from the third. Because the orbital plane of the Moon is tilted with respect to the orbital plane of the Earth (the ecliptic), eclipses can occur only when the Moon is close to the intersection of these two planes (the nodes). The Sun, Earth and nodes are aligned twice a year (during an eclipse season), and eclipses can occur during a period of about two months around these times. There can be from four to seven eclipses in a calendar year, which repeat according to various eclipse cycles, such as a saros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween 1901 and 2100 there are the maximum of seven eclipses in:[12]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcluding penumbral lunar eclipses, there are a maximum of seven eclipses in:[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs observed from the Earth, a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes in front of the Sun. The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Earth intersects the umbra portion of the Moon\u0027s shadow. When the umbra does not reach the surface of the Earth, the Sun is only partially occulted, resulting in an annular eclipse. Partial solar eclipses occur when the viewer is inside the penumbra.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the Sun\u0027s diameter that is covered by the Moon. For a total eclipse, this value is always greater than or equal to one. In both annular and total eclipses, the eclipse magnitude is the ratio of the angular sizes of the Moon to the Sun.[15]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolar eclipses are relatively brief events that can only be viewed in totality along a relatively narrow track. Under the most favorable circumstances, a total solar eclipse can last for 7 minutes, 31 seconds, and can be viewed along a track that is up to 250 km wide. However, the region where a partial eclipse can be observed is much larger. The Moon\u0027s umbra will advance eastward at a rate of 1,700 km/h, until it no longer intersects the Earth\u0027s surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring a solar eclipse, the Moon can sometimes perfectly cover the Sun because its apparent size is nearly the same as the Sun\u0027s when viewed from the Earth. A total solar eclipse is in fact an occultation while an annular solar eclipse is a transit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen observed at points in space other than from the Earth\u0027s surface, the Sun can be eclipsed by bodies other than the Moon. Two examples include when the crew of Apollo 12 observed the Earth to eclipse the Sun in 1969 and when the Cassini probe observed Saturn to eclipse the Sun in 2006.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunar eclipses occur when the Moon passes through the Earth\u0027s shadow. This happens only during a full moon, when the Moon is on the far side of the Earth from the Sun. Unlike a solar eclipse, an eclipse of the Moon can be observed from nearly an entire hemisphere. For this reason it is much more common to observe a lunar eclipse from a given location. A lunar eclipse lasts longer, taking several hours to complete, with totality itself usually averaging anywhere from about 30 minutes to over an hour.[16]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three types of lunar eclipses: penumbral, when the Moon crosses only the Earth\u0027s penumbra; partial, when the Moon crosses partially into the Earth\u0027s umbra; and total, when the Moon crosses entirely into the Earth\u0027s umbra. Total lunar eclipses pass through all three phases. Even during a total lunar eclipse, however, the Moon is not completely dark. Sunlight refracted through the Earth\u0027s atmosphere enters the umbra and provides a faint illumination. Much as in a sunset, the atmosphere tends to more strongly scatter light with shorter wavelengths, so the illumination of the Moon by refracted light has a red hue,[17] thus the phrase \u0027Blood Moon\u0027 is often found in descriptions of such lunar events as far back as eclipses are recorded.[18]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecords of solar eclipses have been kept since ancient times. Eclipse dates can be used for chronological dating of historical records. A Syrian clay tablet, in the Ugaritic language, records a solar eclipse which occurred on March 5, 1223, B.C.,[19] while Paul Griffin argues that a stone in Ireland records an eclipse on November 30, 3340 B.C.[20] Positing classical-era astronomers\u0027 use of Babylonian eclipse records mostly from the 13th century BC provides a feasible and mathematically consistent[21] explanation for the Greek finding all three lunar mean motions (synodic, anomalistic, draconitic) to a precision of about one part in a million or better. Chinese historical records of solar eclipses date back over 3,000 years and have been used to measure changes in the Earth\u0027s rate of spin.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first person to give scientific explanation on eclipses was Anaxagoras [c500BC - 428BC].[23] Anaxagoras stated that the Moon shines by reflected light from the Sun.[24]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 5th century AD, solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata, in his treatise Aryabhatiya.[25] Aryabhata states that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight and explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth. Aryabhata provides the computation and the size of the eclipsed part during an eclipse. Indian computations were very accurate that 18th-century French scientist Guillaume Le Gentil, during a visit to Pondicherry, India, found the Indian computations of the duration of the lunar eclipse of 30 August 1765 to be short by only 41 seconds, whereas Le Gentil\u0027s charts were long by 68 seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the 1600s, European astronomers were publishing books with diagrams explaining how lunar and solar eclipses occurred.[26][27] In order to disseminate this information to a broader audience and decrease fear of the consequences of eclipses, booksellers printed broadsides explaining the event either using the science or via astrology.[28]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe American author Gene Weingarten described the tension between belief and eclipses thus: \"I am a devout atheist but can\u0027t explain why the moon is exactly the right size, and gets positioned so precisely between the Earth and the sun, that total solar eclipses are perfect. It bothers me.\"[29]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Graeco-Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing between AD 211-229, relates the anecdote that Emperor Claudius considered it necessary to prevent disturbance among the Roman population by publishing a prediction for a solar eclipse which would fall on his birthday anniversary [1 August in the year AD 45]. In this context, Cassius Dio provides a detailed explanation of solar and lunar eclipses.[30]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically in mythology, eclipses were understood to be one variation or another of a spiritual battle between the sun and evil forces or spirits of darkness.[31] More specifically, in Norse mythology, it is believed that there is a wolf by the name of Fenrir that is in constant pursuit of the Sun, and eclipses are thought to occur when the wolf successfully devours the divine Sun.[32][failed verification] Other Norse tribes believe that there are two wolves by the names of SkÃ¶ll and Hati that are in pursuit of the Sun and the Moon, known by the names of Sol and Mani, and these tribes believe that an eclipse occurs when one of the wolves successfully eats either the Sun or the Moon.[33]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn most types of mythologies and certain religions, eclipses were seen as a sign that the gods were angry and that danger was soon to come, so people often altered their actions in an effort to dissuade the gods from unleashing their wrath. In the Hindu religion, for example, people often sing religious hymns for protection from the evil spirits of the eclipse, and many people of the Hindu religion refuse to eat during an eclipse to avoid the effects of the evil spirits.[34] Hindu people living in India will also wash off in the Ganges River, which is believed to be spiritually cleansing, directly following an eclipse to clean themselves of the evil spirits.[34] In early Judaism and Christianity, eclipses were viewed as signs from God, and some eclipses were seen as a display of God\u0027s greatness or even signs of cycles of life and death.[34] However, more ominous eclipses such as a blood moon were believed to be a divine sign that God would soon destroy their enemies.[34]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gas giant planets have many moons and thus frequently display eclipses. The most striking involve Jupiter, which has four large moons and a low axial tilt, making eclipses more frequent as these bodies pass through the shadow of the larger planet. Transits occur with equal frequency. It is common to see the larger moons casting circular shadows upon Jupiter\u0027s cloudtops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eclipses of the Galilean moons by Jupiter became accurately predictable once their orbital elements were known. During the 1670s, it was discovered that these events were occurring about 17 minutes later than expected when Jupiter was on the far side of the Sun. Ole RÃ¸mer deduced that the delay was caused by the time needed for light to travel from Jupiter to the Earth. This was used to produce the first estimate of the speed of light.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe timing of the Jovian satellite eclipses was also used to calculate an observer\u0027s longitude upon the Earth. By knowing the expected time when an eclipse would be observed at a standard longitude (such as Greenwich), the time difference could be computed by accurately observing the local time of the eclipse. The time difference gives the longitude of the observer because every hour of difference corresponded to 15Â° around the Earth\u0027s equator. This technique was used, for example, by Giovanni D. Cassini in 1679 to re-map France.[36]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other three gas giants (Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) eclipses only occur at certain periods during the planet\u0027s orbit, due to their higher inclination between the orbits of the moon and the orbital plane of the planet. The moon Titan, for example, has an orbital plane tilted about 1.6Â° to Saturn\u0027s equatorial plane. But Saturn has an axial tilt of nearly 27Â°. The orbital plane of Titan only crosses the line of sight to the Sun at two points along Saturn\u0027s orbit. As the orbital period of Saturn is 29.7 years, an eclipse is only possible about every 15 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Mars, only partial solar eclipses (transits) are possible, because neither of its moons is large enough, at their respective orbital radii, to cover the Sun\u0027s disc as seen from the surface of the planet. Eclipses of the moons by Mars are not only possible, but commonplace, with hundreds occurring each Earth year. There are also rare occasions when Deimos is eclipsed by Phobos.[37] Martian eclipses have been photographed from both the surface of Mars and from orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePluto, with its proportionately largest moon Charon, is also the site of many eclipses. A series of such mutual eclipses occurred between 1985 and 1990.[38] These daily events led to the first accurate measurements of the physical parameters of both objects.[39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEclipses are impossible on Mercury and Venus, which have no moons. However, as seen from the Earth, both have been observed to transit across the face of the Sun. Transits of Venus occur in pairs separated by an interval of eight years, but each pair of events happen less than once a century.[40] According to NASA, the next pair of Venus transits will occur on December 10, 2117, and December 8, 2125. Transits of Mercury are much more common, occurring 13 times each century, on average.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA binary star system consists of two stars that orbit around their common centre of mass. The movements of both stars lie on a common orbital plane in space. When this plane is very closely aligned with the location of an observer, the stars can be seen to pass in front of each other. The result is a type of extrinsic variable star system called an eclipsing binary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maximum luminosity of an eclipsing binary system is equal to the sum of the luminosity contributions from the individual stars. When one star passes in front of the other, the luminosity of the system is seen to decrease. The luminosity returns to normal once the two stars are no longer in alignment.[42]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first eclipsing binary star system to be discovered was Algol, a star system in the constellation Perseus. Normally this star system has a visual magnitude of 2.1. However, every 2.867 days the magnitude decreases to 3.4 for more than nine hours. This is caused by the passage of the dimmer member of the pair in front of the brighter star.[43] The concept that an eclipsing body caused these luminosity variations was introduced by John Goodricke in 1783.[44]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun â Moon â Earth: Solar eclipse | annular eclipse | hybrid eclipse | partial eclipse\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun â Earth â Moon: Lunar eclipse | penumbral eclipse | partial lunar eclipse | central lunar eclipse\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun â Phobos â Mars: Transit of Phobos from Mars | Solar eclipses on Mars\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun â Deimos â Mars: Transit of Deimos from Mars | Solar eclipses on Mars\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther types: Solar eclipses on Jupiter | Solar eclipses on Saturn | Solar eclipses on Uranus | Solar eclipses on Neptune | Solar eclipses on Pluto\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.w3schools.com/c/","html":"\u003cp\u003eW3Schools offers a wide range of services and products for beginners and professionals, helping millions of people everyday to learn and master new skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoy our free tutorials like millions of other internet users since 1999\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplore our selection of references covering all popular coding languages\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate your own website with W3Schools Spaces - no setup required\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTest your skills with different exercises\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTest yourself with multiple choice questions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocument your knowledge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate a free W3Schools Account to Improve Your Learning Experience\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrack your learning progress at W3Schools and collect rewards\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecome a PLUS user and unlock powerful features (ad-free, hosting, support,..)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot sure where you want to start?

First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997[update], C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for making things like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[15] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[15] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g., e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches or space probes).[16]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20).[17] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.[18] Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule[19] with C++23 as the next planned standard.[20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on \" C with Classes\", the predecessor to C++.[21] The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup\u0027s experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT\u0026T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features.[22] C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable, and widely used. In addition to C and Simula\u0027s influences, other languages influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU, and ML.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, Stroustrup\u0027s \"C with Classes\" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining, and default arguments.[23]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named \"C++\" (++ being the increment operator in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL-style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, Cfront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1984, Stroustrup implemented the first stream input/output library. The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy[2] (who had previously suggested Unix pipes).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.[24] The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.[21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991.[25] New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a Boolean type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update (C++03) was released in 2003.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in C++17.[26] After becoming finalized in February 2020,[27] a draft of the C++20 standard was approved on 4 September 2020, and officially published on 15 December 2020.[28][29]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering, \"for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language\".[30]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of December 2022[update], C++ ranked third on the TIOBE index, surpassing Java for the first time in the history of the index.

When Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he indicated that it was given in a tongue-in-cheek spirit.

So far, it has published six revisions of the C++ standard and is currently working on the next revision, C++23.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1998, the ISO working group standardized C++ for the first time as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which is informally known as C++98. In 2003, it published a new version of the C++ standard called ISO/IEC 14882:2003, which fixed problems identified in C++98.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next major revision of the standard was informally referred to as \"C++0x\", but it was not released until 2011.[39] C++11 (14882:2011) included many additions to both the core language and the standard library.[36]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2014, C++14 (also known as C++1y) was released as a small extension to C++11, featuring mainly bug fixes and small improvements.[40] The Draft International Standard ballot procedures completed in mid-August 2014.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter C++14, a major revision C++17, informally known as C++1z, was completed by the ISO C++ committee in mid July 2017 and was approved and published in December 2017.[42]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the standardization process, ISO also publishes technical reports and specifications:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore technical specifications are in development and pending approval, including new set of concurrency extensions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as \"a light-weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions\";[15] and \"offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages.\"[60]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ inherits most of C\u0027s syntax. The following is Bjarne Stroustrup\u0027s version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output:[61][62][note 2]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs in C, C++ supports four types of memory management: static storage duration objects, thread storage duration objects, automatic storage duration objects, and dynamic storage duration objects.[63]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatic storage duration objects are created before main() is entered (see exceptions below) and destroyed in reverse order of creation after main() exits. The exact order of creation is not specified by the standard (though there are some rules defined below) to allow implementations some freedom in how to organize their implementation. More formally, objects of this type have a lifespan that \"shall last for the duration of the program\".[64]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatic storage duration objects are initialized in two phases. First, \"static initialization\" is performed, and only after all static initialization is performed, \"dynamic initialization\" is performed. In static initialization, all objects are first initialized with zeros; after that, all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression (i.e. variables initialized with a literal or constexpr). Though it is not specified in the standard, the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data partition of the executable. Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call (unless the function is marked with constexpr, in C++11). The dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the compilation unit (i.e. the same file). No guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVariables of this type are very similar to static storage duration objects. The main difference is the creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruction is done after the thread has been joined.[65]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common variable types in C++ are local variables inside a function or block, and temporary variables.[66] The common feature about automatic variables is that they have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable. They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration (see below for details) and destroyed in the reverse order of creation when the scope is left. This is implemented by allocation on the stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C++ destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed RAII, which is widely used in C++.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMember variables are created when the parent object is created. Array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order. Member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation. i.e. If the parent is an \"automatic object\" then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated (usually at the ; at the end of a statement).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese objects have a dynamic lifespan and can be created directly with a call to new and destroyed explicitly with a call to delete.[67] C++ also supports malloc and free, from C, but these are not compatible with new and delete. Use of new returns an address to the allocated memory. The C++ Core Guidelines advise against using new directly for creating dynamic objects in favor of smart pointers through make_unique\u003cT\u003e for single ownership and make_shared\u003cT\u003e for reference-counted multiple ownership,[68] which were introduced in C++11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ templates enable generic programming. C++ supports function, class, alias, and variable templates. Templates may be parameterized by types, compile-time constants, and other templates. Templates are implemented by instantiation at compile-time. To instantiate a template, compilers substitute specific arguments for a template\u0027s parameters to generate a concrete function or class instance. Some substitutions are not possible; these are eliminated by an overload resolution policy described by the phrase \"Substitution failure is not an error\" (SFINAE). Templates are a powerful tool that can be used for generic programming, template metaprogramming, and code optimization, but this power implies a cost. Template use may increase object code size, because each template instantiation produces a copy of the template code: one for each set of template arguments, however, this is the same or smaller amount of code that would be generated if the code were written by hand.[69] This is in contrast to run-time generics seen in other languages (e.g., Java) where at compile-time the type is erased and a single template body is preserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemplates are different from macros: while both of these compile-time language features enable conditional compilation, templates are not restricted to lexical substitution. Templates are aware of the semantics and type system of their companion language, as well as all compile-time type definitions, and can perform high-level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation of strictly type-checked parameters. Macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria, but cannot instantiate new types, recurse, or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre-compilation text-substitution and text-inclusion/exclusion. In other words, macros can control compilation flow based on pre-defined symbols but cannot, unlike templates, independently instantiate new symbols. Templates are a tool for static polymorphism (see below) and generic programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, templates are a compile-time mechanism in C++ that is Turing-complete, meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, by a template metaprogram prior to runtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn summary, a template is a compile-time parameterized function or class written without knowledge of the specific arguments used to instantiate it. After instantiation, the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes (encoded in templates) from specific aspects (encoded in template parameters) without sacrificing performance due to abstraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) features to C. It offers classes, which provide the four features commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. One distinguishing feature of C++ classes compared to classes in other programming languages is support for deterministic destructors, which in turn provide support for the Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) concept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncapsulation is the hiding of information to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended and to make the usage model more obvious to the developer. C++ provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation. A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class (\"friends\"). A protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe object-oriented principle ensures the encapsulation of all and only the functions that access the internal representation of a type. C++ supports this principle via member functions and friend functions, but it does not enforce it. Programmers can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and they are allowed to make public entities not part of the representation of a type. Therefore, C++ supports not just object-oriented programming, but other decomposition paradigms such as modular programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is generally considered good practice to make all data private or protected, and to make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class. This can hide the details of data implementation, allowing the designer to later fundamentally change the implementation without changing the interface in any way.[70][71]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInheritance allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types. Inheritance from a base class may be declared as public, protected, or private. This access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public and protected members of the base class. Only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by \"inheritance\". The other two forms are much less frequently used. If the access specifier is omitted, a \"class\" inherits privately, while a \"struct\" inherits publicly. Base classes may be declared as virtual; this is called virtual inheritance. Virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph, avoiding some of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMultiple inheritance is a C++ feature allowing a class to be derived from more than one base class; this allows for more elaborate inheritance relationships. For example, a \"Flying Cat\" class can inherit from both \"Cat\" and \"Flying Mammal\". Some other languages, such as C# or Java, accomplish something similar (although more limited) by allowing inheritance of multiple interfaces while restricting the number of base classes to one (interfaces, unlike classes, provide only declarations of member functions, no implementation or member data). An interface as in C# and Java can be defined in C++ as a class containing only pure virtual functions, often known as an abstract base class or \"ABC\". The member functions of such an abstract base class are normally explicitly defined in the derived class, not inherited implicitly. C++ virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called dominance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be overloaded for user-defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access (. and .*) and the conditional operator. The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user-defined types in C++ seem like built-in types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C++ programming techniques, such as smart pointers. Overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands that the operator uses (any operand may however be ignored by the operator, though it will be evaluated prior to execution). Overloaded \"\u0026\u0026\" and \"||\" operators lose their short-circuit evaluation property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolymorphism enables one common interface for many implementations, and for objects to act differently under different circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ supports several kinds of static (resolved at compile-time) and dynamic (resolved at run-time) polymorphisms, supported by the language features described above. Compile-time polymorphism does not allow for certain run-time decisions, while runtime polymorphism typically incurs a performance penalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunction overloading allows programs to declare multiple functions having the same name but with different arguments (i.e. ad hoc polymorphism). The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their formal parameters. Thus, the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context in which it is used. The type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions and differing return types would result in a compile-time error message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen declaring a function, a programmer can specify for one or more parameters a default value. Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, in which case the default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters at the end of the parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemplates in C++ provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic, polymorphic code (i.e. parametric polymorphism). In particular, through the curiously recurring template pattern, it is possible to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual functions. Because C++ templates are type-aware and Turing-complete, they can also be used to let the compiler resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through template metaprogramming. Contrary to some opinion, template code will not generate a bulk code after compilation with the proper compiler settings.[69]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVariable pointers and references to a base class type in C++ can also refer to objects of any derived classes of that type. This allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing types (references cannot be directly held in containers). This enables dynamic (run-time) polymorphism, where the referred objects can behave differently, depending on their (actual, derived) types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ also provides the dynamic_cast operator, which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object, via a base reference/pointer, to a more derived type: downcasting. The attempt is necessary as often one does not know which derived type is referenced. (Upcasting, conversion to a more general type, can always be checked/performed at compile-time via static_cast, as ancestral classes are specified in the derived class\u0027s interface, visible to all callers.) dynamic_cast relies on run-time type information (RTTI), metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships. If a dynamic_cast to a pointer fails, the result is the nullptr constant, whereas if the destination is a reference (which cannot be null), the cast throws an exception. Objects known to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with static_cast, bypassing RTTI and the safe runtime type-checking of dynamic_cast, so this should be used only if the programmer is very confident the cast is, and will always be, valid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrdinarily, when a function in a derived class overrides a function in a base class, the function to call is determined by the type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called dynamic dispatch. Virtual member functions or methods[72] allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run-time type of the object. In C++ implementations, this is commonly done using virtual function tables. If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by prepending a fully qualified class name before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to standard member functions, operator overloads and destructors can be virtual. An inexact rule based on practical experience states that if any function in the class is virtual, the destructor should be as well. As the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time, constructors, and by extension copy constructors, cannot be virtual. Nonetheless, a situation may arise where a copy of an object needs to be created when a pointer to a derived object is passed as a pointer to a base object. In such a case, a common solution is to create a clone() (or similar) virtual function that creates and returns a copy of the derived class when called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA member function can also be made \"pure virtual\" by appending it with \u003d 0 after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon. A class containing a pure virtual function is called an abstract class. Objects cannot be created from an abstract class; they can only be derived from. Any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a non-pure definition of it (and all other pure virtual functions) before objects of the derived class can be created. A program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is ill-formed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ provides support for anonymous functions, also known as lambda expressions, with the following form:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince C++20, the keyword template is optional for template parameters of lambda expressions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the lambda takes no parameters, and no return type or other specifiers are used, the () can be omitted; that is,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe return type of a lambda expression can be automatically inferred, if possible; e.g.:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe [capture] list supports the definition of closures. Such lambda expressions are defined in the standard as syntactic sugar for an unnamed function object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eException handling is used to communicate the existence of a runtime problem or error from where it was detected to where the issue can be handled.[73] It permits this to be done in a uniform manner and separately from the main code, while detecting all errors.[74] Should an error occur, an exception is thrown (raised), which is then caught by the nearest suitable exception handler. The exception causes the current scope to be exited, and also each outer scope (propagation) until a suitable handler is found, calling in turn the destructors of any objects in these exited scopes.[75] At the same time, an exception is presented as an object carrying the data about the detected problem.[76]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome C++ style guides, such as Google\u0027s,[77] LLVM\u0027s,[78] and Qt\u0027s,[79] forbid the usage of exceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exception-causing code is placed inside a try block. The exceptions are handled in separate catch blocks (the handlers); each try block can have multiple exception handlers, as it is visible in the example below.[80]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also possible to raise exceptions purposefully, using the throw keyword; these exceptions are handled in the usual way. In some cases, exceptions cannot be used due to technical reasons. One such example is a critical component of an embedded system, where every operation must be guaranteed to complete within a specified amount of time. This cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the maximum time required for an exception to be handled.[81]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike signal handling, in which the handling function is called from the point of failure, exception handling exits the current scope before the catch block is entered, which may be located in the current function or any of the previous function calls currently on the stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ has enumeration types that are directly inherited from C\u0027s and work mostly like these, except that an enumeration is a real type in C++, giving added compile-time checking. Also (as with structs), the C++ enum keyword is combined with a typedef, so that instead of naming the type enum name, simply name it name. This can be simulated in C using a typedef: typedef enum {Value1, Value2} name;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++11 also provides a second kind of enumeration, called a scoped enumeration. These are type-safe: the enumerators are not implicitly converted to an integer type. Among other things, this allows I/O streaming to be defined for the enumeration type. Another feature of scoped enumerations is that the enumerators do not leak, so usage requires prefixing with the name of the enumeration (e.g., Color::Red for the first enumerator in the example below), unless a using enum declaration (introduced in C++20) has been used to bring the enumerators into the current scope. A scoped enumeration is specified by the phrase enum class (or enum struct). For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe underlying type of an enumeration is an implementation-defined integral type that is large enough to hold all enumerated values; it does not have to be the smallest possible type. The underlying type can be specified directly, which allows \"forward declarations\" of enumerations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C++ standard consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes aggregate types (vectors, lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), algorithms (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.), input/output facilities (iostream, for reading from and writing to the console and files), filesystem library, localisation support, smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular expression support, multi-threading library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that does not use C++ exceptions into C++ exceptions, a random number generator, and a slightly modified version of the C standard library (to make it comply with the C++ type system).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large part of the C++ library is based on the Standard Template Library (STL). Useful tools provided by the STL include containers as the collections of objects (such as vectors and lists), iterators that provide array-like access to containers, and algorithms that perform operations such as searching and sorting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, (multi)maps (associative arrays) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the features of the library are accessed by using the #include directive to include a standard header. The C++ Standard Library provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by Alexander Stepanov, who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as \"STL\", as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.).[82]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost C++ compilers, and all major ones, provide a standards-conforming implementation of the C++ standard library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C++ Core Guidelines[83] are an initiative led by Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, and Herb Sutter, the convener and chair of the C++ ISO Working Group, to help programmers write \u0027Modern C++\u0027 by using best practices for the language standards C++11 and newer, and to help developers of compilers and static checking tools to create rules for catching bad programming practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main aim is to efficiently and consistently write type and resource safe C++.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Core Guidelines were announced[84] in the opening keynote at CPPCon 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Guidelines are accompanied by the Guideline Support Library (GSL),[85] a header only library of types and functions to implement the Core Guidelines and static checker tools for enforcing Guideline rules.[86]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo give compiler vendors greater freedom, the C++ standards committee decided not to dictate the implementation of name mangling, exception handling, and other implementation-specific features. The downside of this decision is that object code produced by different compilers is expected to be incompatible. There are, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or operating systems. For example, the Itanium C++ ABI is processor-independent (despite its name) and is implemented by GCC and Clang.[87]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ is often considered to be a superset of C but this is not strictly true.[88] Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly in C++ but there are a few differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example, C allows implicit conversion from void* to other pointer types but C++ does not (for type safety reasons). Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as new and class, which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome incompatibilities have been removed by the 1999 revision of the C standard (C99), which now supports C++ features such as line comments (//) and declarations mixed with code. On the other hand, C99 introduced a number of new features that C++ did not support that were incompatible or redundant in C++, such as variable-length arrays, native complex-number types (however, the std::complex class in the C++ standard library provides similar functionality, although not code-compatible), designated initializers, compound literals, and the restrict keyword.[89] Some of the C99-introduced features were included in the subsequent version of the C++ standard, C++11 (out of those which were not redundant).[90][91][92] However, the C++11 standard introduces new incompatibilities, such as disallowing assignment of a string literal to a character pointer, which remains valid C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo intermix C and C++ code, any function declaration or definition that is to be called from/used both in C and C++ must be declared with C linkage by placing it within an extern \"C\" {/*...*/} block. Such a function may not rely on features depending on name mangling (i.e., function overloading).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite its widespread adoption, some notable programmers have criticized the C++ language, including Linus Torvalds,[93] Richard Stallman,[94] Joshua Bloch, Ken Thompson,[95][96][97] and Donald Knuth.[98][99]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most often criticised points of C++ is its perceived complexity as a language, with the criticism that a large number of non-orthogonal features in practice necessitates restricting code to a subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold, and yet there are a lot of people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, \"Yes, we\u0027re using C++ but we\u0027re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we\u0027re not using operator overloading.\" There are just a bunch of features that you\u0027re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don\u0027t think it\u0027s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else\u0027s code, which I think is such a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonald Knuth (1993, commenting on pre-standardized C++), who said of Edsger Dijkstra that \"to think of programming in C++\" \"would make him physically ill\":[98][99]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem that I have with them today is that... C++ is too complicated. At the moment, it\u0027s impossible for me to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem, they said \"OK, we\u0027ll do them both\". So the language is too baroque for my taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Thompson, who was a colleague of Stroustrup at Bell Labs, gives his assessment:[96][97]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it\u0027s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it\u0027s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it\u0027s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it\u0027s not a good language to transport an algorithmâto say, \"I wrote it; here, take it.\" It\u0027s way too big, way too complex. And it\u0027s obviously built by a committee. Stroustrup campaigned for years and years and years, way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair. And he said \"no\" to no one. He put every feature in that language that ever existed. It wasn\u0027t cleanly designedâit was just the union of everything that came along. And I think it suffered drastically from that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever Brian Kernighan, also a colleague at Bell Labs, disputes this assessment:[100]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC++ has been enormously influential. ... Lots of people say C++ is too big and too complicated etc. etc. but in fact it is a very powerful language and pretty much everything that is in there is there for a really sound reason: it is not somebody doing random invention, it is actually people trying to solve real world problems. Now a lot of the programs that we take for granted today, that we just use, are C++ programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStroustrup himself comments that C++ semantics are much cleaner than its syntax: \"within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.\"[101]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther complaints may include a lack of reflection or garbage collection, long compilation times, perceived feature creep,[102] and verbose error messages, particularly from template metaprogramming.[103]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nextjs/","html":"\u003cp\u003eNext.js is an open-source web development framework based on React and has gained significant popularity due to its amazing features.

In this guide, we will mainly use the Julia REPL. Before you can use either, you will need to download Julia:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor just head to: https://julialang.org/downloads/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you have Julia installed, you should be able to launch it and see:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we can use Julia for all of the exciting things it was built for like Machine Learning or Data Science, we first need to get familiar with the basics of the language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will start by going over variables, types, and conditionals. Then, we will talk about loops, functions, and packages. Last, weâll touch on more advanced concepts like structs and talk about additional learning resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is going to be a whirlwind tour so strap in and get ready! It is also worth noting that this tutorial assumes you have some basic familiarity with programming. If you don\u0027t, check out this course on an Intro to Julia for Nervous Beginners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Julia, variables are dynamically typed, meaning that you do not need to specify the variable\u0027s type when you create it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Note that in code snippets, when you see julia\u003e it means the code is being run in the REPL)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like we defined a variable above and assigned it an integer (whole number), we can also do something similar for strings and other variable types:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen creating variables in Julia, the variable name will always go on the left-hand side, and the value will always go on the right-hand side after the equals sign. We can also create new variables based on the values of other variables:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we can see that the new_balance is now the sum (total) of 238.19 and 10. Note further that the type of new_balance is a float (number with decimal place precision) because when we add a float and int together, we automatically get the type with higher precision, which in this case is a float. We can confirm this by doing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the nature of dynamic typing, variables in Julia can also change type. This means that at one point, holder_balance could be a float, and then later on it could be a string:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may also be excited to know that variable names in Julia are very flexible, in fact, you can do something like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn top of emoji variable names, you can also use any other Unicode variable name which is very helpful when you are trying to represent mathematical ideas. You can access these Unicode variables by doing a \\ and then typing the name, followed by pressing tab:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the variable system in Julia is flexible and provides a huge set of features that make writing Julia code easy while still being expressive. If you want to learn more about variables in Julia, check out the Julia documentation: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/variables/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn programming, you often need to check certain conditions in order to make sure that specific lines of code run. For example, if you write a banking program, you might only want to let someone withdraw money if the amount they are trying to withdraw is less than the amount they have present in their account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet us look at a basic example of a conditional statement in Julia:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet us take a closer look here at some parts of the if statement that might differ from other code you have seen: First, we use no : to denote the end of the line and we also are not required to use () around the statement (though it is encouraged). Next, we don\u0027t use {} or the like to denote the end of the conditional, instead, we use the end keyword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like we used the if statement, we can chain it with an else or an elseif:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can read more about control flow and conditional expressions in the Julia documentation: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/control-flow/#man-conditional-evaluation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two main types of loops in Julia: a for loop and a while loop. As is the same with other languages, the biggest difference is that in a for loop, you are going through a pre-defined number of items whereas, in a while loop, you are iterating until some condition is changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSyntactically, the loops in Julia look very similar in structure to the if conditionals we just looked at:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this example, we first defined a new type: a vector (also called an array). This array is holding a bunch of strings we defined. The behavior is very similar to that of arrays in other languages but it is worth noting that arrays are mutable (meaning you can change the number of items in the array after you create it).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, when we look at the structure of the for loop, you can see that we are iterating through the greeting variable. Each time through, we get a new word (in this case) from the array and assign it to a temporary variable word which we then print out. You will notice that the structure of this loop looks similar to the if statement and again uses the end keyword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we explored for loops, let us switch gears and take a look at a while loop in Julia:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this while loop, we set it up so that it will run indefinitely until the user typed the word \"End\". As you have now seen it a few times, the structure of the loop should start to look familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to see some more examples of loops in Julia, you can check out the Julia Documentation\u0027s section on loops: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/control-flow/#man-loops\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunctions are used to create multiple lines of code, chained together, and accessible when you reference a function name. First, let us look at an example of a basic function:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunctions can also take arguments, just like in other languages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this example, we take in one argument, and then add its value to the print out. But what if we don\u0027t get a string?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, since we are just printing, the function continues to work despite not taking in a string anymore and instead of taking a boolean value (true or false). To prevent this from occurring, we can explicitly type the input arguments as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now the function is defined to take in only a string. Let us test this out to make sure we can only call the function with a string value:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait a second, why is this happening? We re-defined the greetuser function, it should not take true anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we are experiencing here is one of the most powerful underlying features of Julia: Multiple Dispatch. Julia allows us to define functions with the same name and number of arguments but that accept different types. This means we can build either generic or type specific versions of functions which helps immensely with code readability since you don\u0027t need to handle every scenario in one function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe should quickly confirm that we actually defined both functions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe built-in methods function is perfect for this and it tells us we have two functions defined, with the only difference being one takes in any type, and the other takes in just a string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is worth noting that since we defined a specialized version that accepts just a string, anytime we call the function with a string it will call the specialized version. The more generic function will not be called when a string is passed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, let us talk about returning values from a function. In Julia, you have two options, you can use the explicit return keyword, or you can opt to do it implicitly by having the last expression in the function serve as the return value like so:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the above example, the string value \"hi\" is returned from the function since it is the last expression and there is no explicit return statement. You could also define the function like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, from a readability standpoint, it makes sense to use the explicit return statement in case someone reading your code does not know about the implicit return behavior in Julia functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother useful functions feature is the ability to provide optional arguments:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this example, we define response as an optional argument so that we can either allow it to use the default behavior we defined or we can manually override it when necessary. These examples just scratch the surface on what is possible with functions in Julia. If you want to read more about all the cool things you can do, check out: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Julia package manager and package ecosystem are some of the most important features of the language. I actually wrote an entire article on why it is one of the most underrate features of the language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that said, there are two ways to interact with packages in Julia: via the REPL or using the Pkg package. We will mostly focus on the REPL in this post since it is much easier to use in my experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you have Julia installed, you can enter the package manager from the REPL by typing ].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we are in the package manager, there are a few things we commonly want to do:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to see all the possible commands in the REPL, simply enter Pkg mode by typing ] and then type ? followed by the enter / return key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetâs add our first package, Example.jl . To do so, we can run:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhich should provide output that looks something like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor space reasons, I will skip further outputs under the assumption that you are following along with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we think we have a package installed, letâs doublecheck if it is really there by typing status (or st for shorthand) into the package manager:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we can see I have two packages installed, Flux and Example. It also gives me the path to the file which manages my current environment (in this case, global Julia v1.7) along with the package versions I have installed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wanted to remove a package from my active environment, like Flux, I can simply type remove Flux (or rm as the shorthand):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick status afterward shows this was successful:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe now know the very basics of working with packages. But we have committed a major programming crime, using our global package environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have gone over how to manage packages, letâs explore how to use them. Quite simply, you just need to type using packageName to use a specific package you want. One of my favorite new features in Julia 1.7 (highlighted in this blog post) is shown below:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you recall, we removed the Flux package, and of course, I forgot this so I went to use it and load it in by typing using Flux. The REPL automatically prompts me to install it via a simple \"y/n\" prompt. This is a small feature but saves a tremendous amount of time and potential confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is worth noting that there are two ways to access a package\u0027s exported functions: via the using keyword and the import keyword. The big difference is that using automatically brings all of the functions into the current namespace (for which you can think about as a big list of functions which Julia knows the definitions) whereas import gives you access to all of the functions but you have to prefix the function with the package name like: Flux.gradient() where Flux is the name of the package and gradient() is the name of a function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia does not have Object Orientated Programming (OOP) paradigms built into the language like classes. However, structs in Julia can be used similar to classes to create custom objects and types. Below, we will show a basic example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this example, we define a struct to represent a dog. In the struct, we define four attributes which make up the dog object. In the lines after that, we show the code to actually create a dog object and then access some of its attributes. Note that you need not specify the types of the attributes, you could leave it more open. For this example, we defined explicit types to highlight that feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will notice that similar to classes in Python (and other languages), we did not define an explicit constructor to create the dog object. We can, however, define one if that would be useful to use:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we defined a constructor and used the special keyword new in order to create the object at the end of the function. You can also create getters and setters specifically for the dog object by doing the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this example, the get_name function only takes an object of type dog. If you try to pass in something else, it will error out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is worth noting that we also defined the struct to be mutable initially so that we could change the field values after we created the object. You omit the keyword mutable if you want the objects initial state to persist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStructs in Julia not only allow us to create object\u0027s, we also are defining a custom type in the process:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, structs are used heavily across the Julia ecosystem and you can learn more about them in the docs: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#struct\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope that this tutorial helped get you up to speed on many of the core ideas of the Julia language.

There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways. Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn computer science and computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of using it with various algorithms. In some cases, the algorithm\u0027s basic operations are tightly coupled to the data structure\u0027s design. Each data structure contains information about the data values, relationships between the data and -- in some cases -- functions that can be applied to the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, in an object-oriented programming language, the data structure and its associated methods are bound together as part of a class definition. In non-object-oriented languages, there may be functions defined to work with the data structure, but they are not technically part of the data structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical base data types, such as integers or floating-point values, that are available in most computer programming languages are generally insufficient to capture the logical intent for data processing and use. Yet applications that ingest, manipulate and produce information must understand how data should be organized to simplify processing. Data structures bring together the data elements in a logical way and facilitate the effective use, persistence and sharing of data. They provide a formal model that describes the way the data elements are organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData structures are the building blocks for more sophisticated applications. They are designed by composing data elements into a logical unit representing an abstract data type that has relevance to the algorithm or application. An example of an abstract data type is a \"customer name\" that is composed of the character strings for \"first name,\" \"middle name\" and \"last name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not only important to use data structures, but it is also important to choose the proper data structure for each task. Choosing an ill-suited data structure could result in slow runtimes or unresponsive code. Five factors to consider when picking a data structure include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, data structures are used to implement the physical forms of abstract data types. Data structures are a crucial part of designing efficient software. They also play a critical role in algorithm design and how those algorithms are used within computer programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly programming languages -- such as Fortran, C and C++ -- enabled programmers to define their own data structures. Today, many programming languages include an extensive collection of built-in data structures to organize code and information. For example, Python lists and dictionaries, and JavaScript arrays and objects are common coding structures used for storing and retrieving information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftware engineers use algorithms that are tightly coupled with the data structures -- such as lists, queues and mappings from one set of values to another. This approach can be fused in a variety of applications, including managing collections of records in a relational database and creating an index of those records using a data structure called a binary tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome examples of how data structures are used include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData structures are often classified by their characteristics. The following three characteristics are examples:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf data structures are the building blocks of algorithms and computer programs, the primitive -- or base -- data types are the building blocks of data structures. The typical base data types include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe data structure type used in a particular situation is determined by the type of operations that will be required or the kinds of algorithms that will be applied. The various data structure types include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are considered complex data structures as they can store large amounts of interconnected data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen choosing a data structure for a program or application, developers should consider the answers to the following three questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome real-world examples include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImprove analytics maturity with advanced analytics capabilities and the proactive use of data.

And with more than 80% of developers reporting that theyâd like to use the language again next year, you have to wonder how a language created less than 20 years ago has stolen the hearts of developers around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, weâll look at the history of Rust, what itâs commonly used for, why developers love it so much, and some resources to help you start learning one of the top fastest growing languages on GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRustâs print macro displaying the output âHello, World!â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally intended to serve as a safer alternative to C and C++, Rust is a systems programming language that has gained significant popularity among developers thanks to its emphasis on safety, performance, and productivity. Rust is a statically typed language, so variable and expression types are determined and checked at compile time, which helps enhance memory safety and error detection, resulting in more reliable builds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2006, the software developer, Graydon Hoare, started Rust as a personal project while he was working at Mozilla. According to an interview with MIT Technology Review, the inspiration for Rust came from a broken elevator in Hoareâs apartment building. The software for the lift operation system had crashed and Hoare understood that issues like this usually came from problems with how a program uses memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite often, the software for these types of devices is written in C or C++, but these languages require significant memory management, which can lead to errors that would cause the system to crash. So, Hoare set to work on figuring out how to create a programming language that could be both compact and memory bug-free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe later showed the project to a managerâwhich led to Mozilla sponsoring it in 2009 as part of a longer-term effort to incorporate the language into the development of an experimental browser engine. In 2010, Mozilla Research officially announced the Rust project and released the source code to the public as an open-source project. After several years of development, Rust reached a stable and mature stateâand in May 2015, Rust 1.0 was released. This milestone signaled that Rust was ready for production and provided a foundation for developers to build upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFun fact\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust has been said to be named after a particularly robust type of fungi that is âover-engineered for survival,â according to Hoare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the 1.0 release, Rust has exploded in popularity and adoption, with top applications, such as Microsoft Windows, utilizing Rust to rewrite core libraries with its memory-safe code. Outside of the tech giants, Rust also has a vibrant community of developers, or âRustaceans,â that are dedicated to making the Rust experience an active and collaborative one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeet Ferris, the unofficial mascot for Rust!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to a recent survey by SlashData, there are roughly 2.8 million Rust developers worldwide in 2023, a number that has nearly tripled over the past two years. With plenty of active forums, documentation, and a supportive community for developers of all skill levels, itâs perhaps unsurprising that Rust keeps topping the most-desired language lists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what are some of Rustâs key features that make it so attractive to developers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn simple terms, Rust solves some of developersâ most frustrating memory management problems commonly associated with C and C++, but thatâs not its only shining capability. One of GitHubâs staff software engineers, Jason Orendorff, who co-authored a book on programming with Rust, said about the language:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eâTo me, whatâs great about Rust is that itâs both fast AND reliable,â according to Orendorff. âIt lets me write multi-headed programs that run on 16 cores and keep them readable, maintainable, and crash-free. It also lets me write very low-level algorithms requiring control over memory layout and pull in a crate that makes HTTPS requests super simple. Itâs the combination of these features that makes Rust so unique.â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding on that, hereâs a few more of its well-loved characteristics and features:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo garbage collection. Unlike some programming languages, Rust does not employ garbage collection. Instead, its ownership and borrowing rules manage memory, which helps empower developers to have precise control over memory allocation and deallocation for efficient resource management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCargo Package Manager. Rustâs built-in package manager, Cargo, streamlines project management, dependency tracking, and building, which helps contribute to efficient and organized development workflows. But this doesnât make it clear just how bonkers the Cargo ecosystem is. According to Orendorff, âMy team takes advantage of high-quality open source packages for hashing, serialization, multithreading, data structures, compression, and a lot more. These are performance-critical libraries. Without some of these, our project to rethink code search on GitHub wouldnât have been possible.â And hereâs a fun fact: Rust was actually the first systems programming language to have a standard package manager, and, as a result, the Rust ecosystem is incredibly robust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero-cost abstractions. This feature allows developers to write high-level code abstractions and features without introducing any runtime performance overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePattern matching. This powerful language feature enables developers to concisely and effectively match complex data structures against specific patterns to extract and handle different cases or scenarios in a clean and readable manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eType inference. This feature allows Rustâs compiler to automatically detect an expression based on context while you code. âMany programming languages have some type inference,â Orendorff said. âC# and C++ have some, Rust has a little more, and languages like Haskell, Scala, and ML have even more.â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun this code for an inside joke among Rust developers ð\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to its direct access to both hardware and memory, Rust is well suited for embedded systems and bare-metal development. And since itâs a general purpose language, it can also be used for a variety of applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetâs explore a few key use cases:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerformance-critical backend systems are software components or services that handle tasks that require high-speed processing, low-latency responses, and efficient resource utilizationâand Rustâs performance, thread safety, and error handling make it an excellent choice for developing these types of systems. In fact, we use Rust to build some of these systems at GitHub. For example, the backend of our code search feature is written in Rust (and you can read more about the development of GitHubâs newest code search with Rust, too).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust was originally created to solve an operating system issue (remember the elevator problem?)âso, unsurprisingly, itâs often used to build operating systems, kernels, device drivers, or other low-level components where control over memory and performance is crucial. Redox, a Unix-like operating system, was written in Rust, which contributes to its most crucial feature: its security. âFuchsia is another example that was built at Google,â Orendorff said. âIf you have a Google Nest smart speaker, itâs likely running Fuchsia.â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust is also well-suited for writing code that performs tasks that closely interact with the operating system. For example, the Codespaces team at GitHub is leveraging Rust to enhance the speed of starting up the virtual disk within GitHub Codespaces and optimize the utilization of Azure storage. Coursera also employs Rust in its online grading system, as it operates within Docker and needs a language that compiles to machine code with minimal dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterested in building your own OS?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis collection of blog posts provides step-by-step tutorials on how to create a small operating system with Rust. You can also find the source code for that project on GitHub here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust is increasingly being used for web developmentâespecially on the server side. The async programming model and performance characteristics of Rust make it fitting for building high-performance web servers, APIs, and backend services. Plus, thereâs been an influx of web frameworks for Rust, like Rocket, that can help folks get started with writing secure web applications. The emergence of these frameworks underscores Rustâs position as a mature language, and also helps increase the support for folks looking to use Rust in front or backend work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRustâs speed, memory management, and security all contribute to its involvement with cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. For example, Polkadot, which is designed to enable the interoperability and interaction between multiple blockchains to share information and assets in a secure and decentralized manner, utilizes Rust to build its core infrastructure. Polkadotâs runtime logic, which governs the behavior and rules of the blockchain, is also written in Rust.

If theyâre recruiters, they almost feel sick in the stomach about having to find yet another Ruby on Rails âprimadonaâ developer. Then they pull out something similar to this amazingly ignorant comparison between Git and PHP to prove their point. âThey donât even know what theyâre asking for,â they say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor us as programmers, sometimes it does indeed seem like our clients donât have a clue. We love to exaggerate cases like this. When you think a bit about it, it does not seem right to think that a person that is giving me money to build things is somehow limited and âjust doesnât get itâ. In fact, I believe that most clients know their options just fine and yet they still decide to go with Rails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy Ruby on Rails? Iâll try to explain what, in my opinion, makes Rails beneficial enough to be seriously considered for a plethora of projects and needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eItâs possible that nobody would even know about the benefits of Ruby if it werenât for Rails itself. Some people like to belittle Ruby by saying that itâs âso easy for Rubyâ with its âknight in shining armour called Railsâ and that without Rails, âRuby would be irrelevantâ. I canât say for sure whether or not thatâs true, but I do know that it would be a huge shame if the world missed out on such a superb language. The fact is: the author of Rails picked Ruby deliberately, and his âwildâ bet paid off with huge interest. What he saw back then, many others can see today. Ruby somehow enables programmers in a special kind of way that is so hard to explain to the âunwashed massesâ. So, why use the Ruby on Rails framework? Ruby makes programmers happy, as advertised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile most developers agree that Ruby is handy, some see it as too much so. They worry about what might happen with all the freedoms that Ruby allows, all the potential for misuse. Let me illustrate with some monkey patching:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eItâs that easy: with just five lines of code, weâve taken an existing class and overridden its behavior. Nohting is sacredânot even a String. This particular error would be easy to spot, but things can get much more sinister:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like that, weâve introduced an error into the String class that could be wrapped into and obscured by layer upon layer of complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, you might be thinking: Can everybody and their mother mess up my precious application? While this behavior indeed looks scaryâitâs really not. In five years of using Ruby, Iâve had exactly zero problems with this behavior. It may seem counterintuitive, but then again, so is driving cars at 60 MPH in opposite directions separated only by a thin white line in the middle of the road. In practice, both work remarkably well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother benefit is that Ruby is a versatile tool. As such, it has sharp, knife-like edges. I like to think that grown-ups can handle knives just fineâchild-proofing is for, well, children (Tweet). And being treated like a child in IT leaves you a victim of Paul Grahamâs Blub paradox: you think you are better off without certain features that you donât understand or that someone told you are too dangerous. Of course, today we are asking âwhy use Ruby on Railsâ; thus, this is a debate for another time. Admittedly, Ruby misses out on some features that other languages have (Lisp hmm, hmm). All-in-all, Ruby is close to the top of the âlanguage power continuumâ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first few years with Ruby were humbling. I learned so much just from reading through othersâ code. Sometimes, I was amazed; sometimes, I was mad; but eventually, this knowledge enabled me to communicate with my computer much more effectively than before. I almost feel sorry for some other âred tapeâ languages that make you jump through hoops just for the sake of jumping through them, all while telling you âI am just doing whatâs best for you, itâs for your own good!â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a deep respect for pragmatism knitted into Railsâs DNA at the lowest possible level. In combination with the benefits of Ruby, this pragmatism produces elegant solutions and encourages/inspires the Ruby on Rails development community to do the same. Pragmatism is often advertised as a tenet of Rails software, so this claim isnât new, but I was reminded of itâs truthfulness quite recently as a friend of mine tried to show me just how âcoolâ Hibernate really is. He was struggling. I could feel his pain as he was unable to set a myriad of options and configuration parameters that should have been framework defaults in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith age, my standards for artificial complexity have grown higher and higher. Considering that I started writing production code back in 1989 at age 11 (beginning with a project for my next door neighbor in Clipper Summer â87), I have close to zero tolerance for unnecessary complications. And Rails scores really high in that department. Itâs more than just âconvention over configurationâ; I am talking about the whole pragmatic mindset that is highly valued within and permeates through the Rails community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails is as close to English as it gets (unless you are using COBOL). It uses whatâs known as an internal DSL, extending Ruby with its own semantics. Constructing a DSL is always dangerous as you are effectively developing a new language. Because it is internal, you donât need to use an external parser, but in a sense it feels like a new language. The Rails team struck a good balance with its DSL, using it where it makes sense and only seldom overdoing it, demonstrating excellent self-control. I think that any programmer, regardless of Rails experience, (and even some non-programmers) could understand this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, if youâre not familiar with Ruby, this might look oddâitâs almost as if itâs not a programming language. Once you realize that itâs just method calls without parentheses, you are good to go. Still, the Rails DSL feels like it is this special language for describing requirements when in fact it is just smart naming and inherent usage of Rubyâs excellent syntax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails has an army of committers that make sure it stays in tip-top condition. Many projects simmer down with age, yet with Rails, sparks still fly when decisions need to be made. It feels like the maintainers (still) truly care and want people to use Ruby on Rails and understand its benefits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderneath Rails itself, as a cherry on top, stands Ruby with its formidable package manager, RubyGems, comparable to CPAN in terms of number of packagesâand considering CPANâs age, that claim is (to put it mildly) very impressive. Rails had a brief derail when it tried to make its own âRails pluginsâ. Fortunately, this did not stick, so RubyGems remains the unified, superb source for code programmed by very bright individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe synergy between a cool language, pragmatic web framework, and superb community gives Rails a result much better than the sum of its parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails has been around the block. In a hipster kind of way, itâs not even that cool anymore. This is good thing when it comes to choosing a technology stack: you want something proven. And Rails is just that. We recently wrote a piece talking about the wide variety of Ruby interpreters and runtimes that are now available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, I know. As an IT professional, I should really value âseriousâ things and ignore the âglitterâ. It may seem shallow, but lets face it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isnât even about vanity; itâs about engaging as many smart people as you can to put water into the mill. When frameworks are considered, the best place to be is in the crowd. Choosing a framework that these smart people are focusing on simply means that a lot more ground is already covered for you. And this brings me to my next point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a soft spot for tiny frameworks. I like when I can understand what a particular framework is doing and why. In this sense, Rails is somewhat bloated, and even overwhelming at times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dilemma here: how many times do you want to write the same stuff over and over again? Some of it can be rewritten better I am sure, but it takes timeâa lot of time. The more you allow Rails to do for you, the less you have to worry about re-writing or re-implementing your functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRails is (as they say) âbatteries includedâ. This is not a good thing if you are keen on sparsity or if you feel the need to have extensive knowledge of how everything works. In practice, if you let go of your fears, it does seem to work. Rails has reasonable defaults for almost everything you need and is modular enough to avoid cornering you into a tight spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsk yourself again, why use Ruby on Rails? Rails is suitable for both state-of-the-art public websites that compete with Single Page JavaScript applications, and complex enterprise core system applications that usually look a bit âuglierâ (with a more generic, lower fidelity UI), but compensate this blemish with a ton of complicated business rules and logic. Aside from these Ruby on Rails use cases, its benefit is that it is versatile and able to compete with both the sleek and the powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor most of common problems, Rails has a component at your disposal almost right out-of-the-box with documentation that is consistently above average (somehow, the Rails core team persuaded contributors that writing documentation is cool (even though we all know itâs not), leading to well written, concise and time-saving docs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you put aside unicorns and Friday hugs, you end up with a mighty framework that you can be used both for your future game changer and your next middle-of-the-road business site. And with your pool of top-of-the-line gems, you have at your finger tips an arsenal that implements some of the brightest ideas in computer programming.

It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C\u0027s features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.[7] C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[8] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[9][10] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language.[11][1] C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.[12]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC is an imperative, procedural language in the ALGOL tradition. It has a static type system. In C, all executable code is contained within subroutines (also called \"functions\", though not in the sense of functional programming). Function parameters are passed by value, although arrays are passed as pointers, i.e. the address of the first item in the array. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing pointers to the thing being referenced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC program source text is free-form code. Semicolons terminate statements, while curly braces are used to group statements into blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C language also exhibits the following characteristics:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile C does not include certain features found in other languages (such as object orientation and garbage collection), these can be implemented or emulated, often through the use of external libraries (e.g., the GLib Object System or the Boehm garbage collector).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including C++, C#, Unix\u0027s C shell, D, Go, Java, JavaScript (including transpilers), Julia, Limbo, LPC, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Swift, Verilog and SystemVerilog (hardware description languages).[5] These languages have drawn many of their control structures and other basic features from C. Most of them also express highly similar syntax to C, and they tend to combine the recognizable expression and statement syntax of C with underlying type systems, data models, and semantics that can be radically different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe origin of C is closely tied to the development of the Unix operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a PDP-7 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, incorporating several ideas from colleagues. Eventually, they decided to port the operating system to a PDP-11. The original PDP-11 version of Unix was also developed in assembly language.[8]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThompson wanted a programming language for developing utilities for the new platform. At first, he tried to write a Fortran compiler, but soon gave up the idea. Instead, he created a cut-down version of the recently developed systems programming language called BCPL. The official description of BCPL was not available at the time[13] and Thompson modified the syntax to be less wordy, and similar to a simplified ALGOL known as SMALGOL.[14] Thompson called the result B.[8] He described B as \"BCPL semantics with a lot of SMALGOL syntax\".[14] Like BCPL, B had a bootstrapping compiler to facilitate porting to new machines.[14] However, few utilities were ultimately written in B because it was too slow, and could not take advantage of PDP-11 features such as byte addressability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1971, Ritchie started to improve B, to utilise the features of the more-powerful PDP-11. A significant addition was a character data type. He called this New B (NB).[14] Thompson started to use NB to write the Unix kernel, and his requirements shaped the direction of the language development.[14][15] Through to 1972, richer types were added to the NB language: NB had arrays of int and char. Pointers, the ability to generate pointers to other types, arrays of all types, and types to be returned from functions were all also added. Arrays within expressions became pointers. A new compiler was written, and the language was renamed C.[8]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C compiler and some utilities made with it were included in Version 2 Unix, which is also known as Research Unix.[16]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Version 4 Unix, released in November 1973, the Unix kernel was extensively re-implemented in C.[8] By this time, the C language had acquired some powerful features such as struct types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe preprocessor was introduced around 1973 at the urging of Alan Snyder and also in recognition of the usefulness of the file-inclusion mechanisms available in BCPL and PL/I. Its original version provided only included files and simple string replacements: #include and #define of parameterless macros. Soon after that, it was extended, mostly by Mike Lesk and then by John Reiser, to incorporate macros with arguments and conditional compilation.[8]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnix was one of the first operating system kernels implemented in a language other than assembly. Earlier instances include the Multics system (which was written in PL/I) and Master Control Program (MCP) for the Burroughs B5000 (which was written in ALGOL) in 1961. In around 1977, Ritchie and Stephen C. Johnson made further changes to the language to facilitate portability of the Unix operating system. Johnson\u0027s Portable C Compiler served as the basis for several implementations of C on new platforms.[15]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language.[17] Known as K\u0026R from the initials of its authors, the book served for many years as an informal specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as \"K\u0026R C\". As this was released in 1978, it is now also referred to as C78.[18] The second edition of the book[19] covers the later ANSI C standard, described below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK\u0026R introduced several language features:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after the publication of the 1989 ANSI standard, for many years K\u0026R C was still considered the \"lowest common denominator\" to which C programmers restricted themselves when maximum portability was desired, since many older compilers were still in use, and because carefully written K\u0026R C code can be legal Standard C as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn early versions of C, only functions that return types other than int must be declared if used before the function definition; functions used without prior declaration were presumed to return type int.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe int type specifiers which are commented out could be omitted in K\u0026R C, but are required in later standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince K\u0026R function declarations did not include any information about function arguments, function parameter type checks were not performed, although some compilers would issue a warning message if a local function was called with the wrong number of arguments, or if different calls to an external function used different numbers or types of arguments. Separate tools such as Unix\u0027s lint utility were developed that (among other things) could check for consistency of function use across multiple source files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the years following the publication of K\u0026R C, several features were added to the language, supported by compilers from AT\u0026T (in particular PCC[20]) and some other vendors. These included:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large number of extensions and lack of agreement on a standard library, together with the language popularity and the fact that not even the Unix compilers precisely implemented the K\u0026R specification, led to the necessity of standardization.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the late 1970s and 1980s, versions of C were implemented for a wide variety of mainframe computers, minicomputers, and microcomputers, including the IBM PC, as its popularity began to increase significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. X3J11 based the C standard on the Unix implementation; however, the non-portable portion of the Unix C library was handed off to the IEEE working group 1003 to become the basis for the 1988 POSIX standard. In 1989, the C standard was ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 \"Programming Language C\". This version of the language is often referred to as ANSI C, Standard C, or sometimes C89.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1990, the ANSI C standard (with formatting changes) was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, which is sometimes called C90. Therefore, the terms \"C89\" and \"C90\" refer to the same programming language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eANSI, like other national standards bodies, no longer develops the C standard independently, but defers to the international C standard, maintained by the working group ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14. National adoption of an update to the international standard typically occurs within a year of ISO publication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the aims of the C standardization process was to produce a superset of K\u0026R C, incorporating many of the subsequently introduced unofficial features. The standards committee also included several additional features such as function prototypes (borrowed from C++), void pointers, support for international character sets and locales, and preprocessor enhancements. Although the syntax for parameter declarations was augmented to include the style used in C++, the K\u0026R interface continued to be permitted, for compatibility with existing source code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC89 is supported by current C compilers, and most modern C code is based on it. Any program written only in Standard C and without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any platform with a conforming C implementation, within its resource limits. Without such precautions, programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as GUI libraries, or to a reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of data types and byte endianness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn cases where code must be compilable by either standard-conforming or K\u0026R C-based compilers, the __STDC__ macro can be used to split the code into Standard and K\u0026R sections to prevent the use on a K\u0026R C-based compiler of features available only in Standard C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the ANSI/ISO standardization process, the C language specification remained relatively static for several years. In 1995, Normative Amendment 1 to the 1990 C standard (ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, known informally as C95) was published, to correct some details and to add more extensive support for international character sets.[21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C standard was further revised in the late 1990s, leading to the publication of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 in 1999, which is commonly referred to as \"C99\". It has since been amended three times by Technical Corrigenda.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC99 introduced several new features, including inline functions, several new data types (including long long int and a complex type to represent complex numbers), variable-length arrays and flexible array members, improved support for IEEE 754 floating point, support for variadic macros (macros of variable arity), and support for one-line comments beginning with //, as in BCPL or C++. Many of these had already been implemented as extensions in several C compilers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC99 is for the most part backward compatible with C90, but is stricter in some ways; in particular, a declaration that lacks a type specifier no longer has int implicitly assumed. A standard macro __STDC_VERSION__ is defined with value 199901L to indicate that C99 support is available. GCC, Solaris Studio, and other C compilers now[when?] support many or all of the new features of C99. The C compiler in Microsoft Visual C++, however, implements the C89 standard and those parts of C99 that are required for compatibility with C++11.[23][needs update]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the C99 standard requires support for identifiers using Unicode in the form of escaped characters (e.g. \\u0040 or \\U0001f431) and suggests support for raw Unicode names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2007, work began on another revision of the C standard, informally called \"C1X\" until its official publication of ISO/IEC 9899:2011 on 2011-12-08. The C standards committee adopted guidelines to limit the adoption of new features that had not been tested by existing implementations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C11 standard adds numerous new features to C and the library, including type generic macros, anonymous structures, improved Unicode support, atomic operations, multi-threading, and bounds-checked functions. It also makes some portions of the existing C99 library optional, and improves compatibility with C++. The standard macro __STDC_VERSION__ is defined as 201112L to indicate that C11 support is available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePublished in June 2018 as ISO/IEC 9899:2018, C17 is the current standard for the C programming language. It introduces no new language features, only technical corrections, and clarifications to defects in C11. The standard macro __STDC_VERSION__ is defined as 201710L to indicate that C17 support is available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC23 is the informal name for the next (after C17) major C language standard revision. It was informally known as \"C2X\" through most of its development. C23 is expected to be published in early 2024 as ISO/IEC 9899:2024.[24] The standard macro __STDC_VERSION__ is defined as 202311L to indicate that C23 support is available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC2Y is a temporary informal name for the next major C language standard revision, after C23 (C2X), that is hoped to be released later in the 2020s decade, per the two in \"C2Y\". An early working draft of C2Y was released in February 2024 as N3220 by the working group ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14.[25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, embedded C programming requires nonstandard extensions to the C language in order to support exotic features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2008, the C Standards Committee published a technical report extending the C language[26] to address these issues by providing a common standard for all implementations to adhere to. It includes a number of features not available in normal C, such as fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces, and basic I/O hardware addressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC has a formal grammar specified by the C standard.[27] Line endings are generally not significant in C; however, line boundaries do have significance during the preprocessing phase. Comments may appear either between the delimiters /* and */, or (since C99) following // until the end of the line. Comments delimited by /* and */ do not nest, and these sequences of characters are not interpreted as comment delimiters if they appear inside string or character literals.[28]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC source files contain declarations and function definitions. Function definitions, in turn, contain declarations and statements. Declarations either define new types using keywords such as struct, union, and enum, or assign types to and perhaps reserve storage for new variables, usually by writing the type followed by the variable name. Keywords such as char and int specify built-in types. Sections of code are enclosed in braces ({ and }, sometimes called \"curly brackets\") to limit the scope of declarations and to act as a single statement for control structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an imperative language, C uses statements to specify actions. The most common statement is an expression statement, consisting of an expression to be evaluated, followed by a semicolon; as a side effect of the evaluation, functions may be called and variables may be assigned new values. To modify the normal sequential execution of statements, C provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords. Structured programming is supported by if ... [else] conditional execution and by do ... while, while, and for iterative execution (looping). The for statement has separate initialization, testing, and reinitialization expressions, any or all of which can be omitted. break and continue can be used within the loop. Break is used to leave the innermost enclosing loop statement and continue is used to skip to its reinitialisation. There is also a non-structured goto statement which branches directly to the designated label within the function. switch selects a case to be executed based on the value of an integer expression. Different from many other languages, control-flow will fall through to the next case unless terminated by a break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpressions can use a variety of built-in operators and may contain function calls. The order in which arguments to functions and operands to most operators are evaluated is unspecified. The evaluations may even be interleaved. However, all side effects (including storage to variables) will occur before the next \"sequence point\"; sequence points include the end of each expression statement, and the entry to and return from each function call. Sequence points also occur during evaluation of expressions containing certain operators (\u0026\u0026, ||, ?: and the comma operator). This permits a high degree of object code optimization by the compiler, but requires C programmers to take more care to obtain reliable results than is needed for other programming languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKernighan and Ritchie say in the Introduction of The C Programming Language: \"C, like any other language, has its blemishes. Some of the operators have the wrong precedence; some parts of the syntax could be better.\"[29] The C standard did not attempt to correct many of these blemishes, because of the impact of such changes on already existing software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe basic C source character set includes the following characters:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewline indicates the end of a text line; it need not correspond to an actual single character, although for convenience C treats it as one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditional multi-byte encoded characters may be used in string literals, but they are not entirely portable. The latest C standard (C11) allows multi-national Unicode characters to be embedded portably within C source text by using \\uXXXX or \\UXXXXXXXX encoding (where the X denotes a hexadecimal character), although this feature is not yet widely implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe basic C execution character set contains the same characters, along with representations for alert, backspace, and carriage return. Run-time support for extended character sets has increased with each revision of the C standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following reserved words are case sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC89 has 32 reserved words, also known as keywords, which are the words that cannot be used for any purposes other than those for which they are predefined:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC99 reserved five more words: (â¡ is an alternative spelling alias for a C23 keyword)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC11 reserved seven more words:[30] (â¡ is an alternative spelling alias for a C23 keyword)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC23 reserved fifteen more words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the recently reserved words begin with an underscore followed by a capital letter, because identifiers of that form were previously reserved by the C standard for use only by implementations. Since existing program source code should not have been using these identifiers, it would not be affected when C implementations started supporting these extensions to the programming language. Some standard headers do define more convenient synonyms for underscored identifiers. Some of those words were added as keywords with their conventional spelling in C23 and the corresponding macros were removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to C89, entry was reserved as a keyword. In the second edition of their book The C Programming Language, which describes what became known as C89, Kernighan and Ritchie wrote, \"The ... [keyword] entry, formerly reserved but never used, is no longer reserved.\" and \"The stillborn entry keyword is withdrawn.\"[31]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC supports a rich set of operators, which are symbols used within an expression to specify the manipulations to be performed while evaluating that expression. C has operators for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC uses the operator \u003d (used in mathematics to express equality) to indicate assignment, following the precedent of Fortran and PL/I, but unlike ALGOL and its derivatives. C uses the operator \u003d\u003d to test for equality. The similarity between these two operators (assignment and equality) may result in the accidental use of one in place of the other, and in many cases, the mistake does not produce an error message (although some compilers produce warnings). For example, the conditional expression if (a \u003d\u003d b + 1) might mistakenly be written as if (a \u003d b + 1), which will be evaluated as true unless the value of a is 0 after the assignment.[32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C operator precedence is not always intuitive. For example, the operator \u003d\u003d binds more tightly than (is executed prior to) the operators \u0026 (bitwise AND) and | (bitwise OR) in expressions such as x \u0026 1 \u003d\u003d 0, which must be written as (x \u0026 1) \u003d\u003d 0 if that is the coder\u0027s intent.[33]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"hello, world\" example, which appeared in the first edition of K\u0026R, has become the model for an introductory program in most programming textbooks. The program prints \"hello, world\" to the standard output, which is usually a terminal or screen display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original version was:[34]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA standard-conforming \"hello, world\" program is:[a]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first line of the program contains a preprocessing directive, indicated by #include. This causes the compiler to replace that line with the entire text of the stdio.h standard header, which contains declarations for standard input and output functions such as printf and scanf. The angle brackets surrounding stdio.h indicate that stdio.h can be located using a search strategy that prefers headers provided with the compiler to other headers having the same name, as opposed to double quotes which typically include local or project-specific header files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next line indicates that a function named main is being defined. The main function serves a special purpose in C programs; the run-time environment calls the main function to begin program execution. The type specifier int indicates that the value that is returned to the invoker (in this case the run-time environment) as a result of evaluating the main function, is an integer. The keyword void as a parameter list indicates that this function takes no arguments.[b]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opening curly brace indicates the beginning of the definition of the main function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next line calls (diverts execution to) a function named printf, which in this case is supplied from a system library. In this call, the printf function is passed (provided with) a single argument, the address of the first character in the string literal \"hello, world\\n\". The string literal is an unnamed array with elements of type char, set up automatically by the compiler with a final NULL(ASCII value 0) character to mark the end of the array (for printf to know the length of the string).The NULL character can be also written as an escape sequence, written as \\0. The \\n is an escape sequence that C translates to a newline character, which on output signifies the end of the current line. The return value of the printf function is of type int, but it is silently discarded since it is not used. (A more careful program might test the return value to determine whether or not the printf function succeeded.) The semicolon ; terminates the statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closing curly brace indicates the end of the code for the main function. According to the C99 specification and newer, the main function, unlike any other function, will implicitly return a value of 0 upon reaching the } that terminates the function. (Formerly an explicit return 0; statement was required.) This is interpreted by the run-time system as an exit code indicating successful execution.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe type system in C is static and weakly typed, which makes it similar to the type system of ALGOL descendants such as Pascal.[36] There are built-in types for integers of various sizes, both signed and unsigned, floating-point numbers, and enumerated types (enum). Integer type char is often used for single-byte characters. C99 added a Boolean datatype. There are also derived types including arrays, pointers, records (struct), and unions (union).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC is often used in low-level systems programming where escapes from the type system may be necessary. The compiler attempts to ensure type correctness of most expressions, but the programmer can override the checks in various ways, either by using a type cast to explicitly convert a value from one type to another, or by using pointers or unions to reinterpret the underlying bits of a data object in some other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome find C\u0027s declaration syntax unintuitive, particularly for function pointers. (Ritchie\u0027s idea was to declare identifiers in contexts resembling their use: \"declaration reflects use\".)[37]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC\u0027s usual arithmetic conversions allow for efficient code to be generated, but can sometimes produce unexpected results. For example, a comparison of signed and unsigned integers of equal width requires a conversion of the signed value to unsigned. This can generate unexpected results if the signed value is negative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC supports the use of pointers, a type of reference that records the address or location of an object or function in memory. Pointers can be dereferenced to access data stored at the address pointed to, or to invoke a pointed-to function. Pointers can be manipulated using assignment or pointer arithmetic. The run-time representation of a pointer value is typically a raw memory address (perhaps augmented by an offset-within-word field), but since a pointer\u0027s type includes the type of the thing pointed to, expressions including pointers can be type-checked at compile time. Pointer arithmetic is automatically scaled by the size of the pointed-to data type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePointers are used for many purposes in C. Text strings are commonly manipulated using pointers into arrays of characters. Dynamic memory allocation is performed using pointers; the result of a malloc is usually cast to the data type of the data to be stored. Many data types, such as trees, are commonly implemented as dynamically allocated struct objects linked together using pointers. Pointers to other pointers are often used in multi-dimensional arrays and arrays of struct objects. Pointers to functions (function pointers) are useful for passing functions as arguments to higher-order functions (such as qsort or bsearch), in dispatch tables, or as callbacks to event handlers .[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA null pointer value explicitly points to no valid location. Dereferencing a null pointer value is undefined, often resulting in a segmentation fault. Null pointer values are useful for indicating special cases such as no \"next\" pointer in the final node of a linked list, or as an error indication from functions returning pointers. In appropriate contexts in source code, such as for assigning to a pointer variable, a null pointer constant can be written as 0, with or without explicit casting to a pointer type, as the NULL macro defined by several standard headers or, since C23 with the constant nullptr. In conditional contexts, null pointer values evaluate to false, while all other pointer values evaluate to true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoid pointers (void *) point to objects of unspecified type, and can therefore be used as \"generic\" data pointers. Since the size and type of the pointed-to object is not known, void pointers cannot be dereferenced, nor is pointer arithmetic on them allowed, although they can easily be (and in many contexts implicitly are) converted to and from any other object pointer type.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareless use of pointers is potentially dangerous. Because they are typically unchecked, a pointer variable can be made to point to any arbitrary location, which can cause undesirable effects. Although properly used pointers point to safe places, they can be made to point to unsafe places by using invalid pointer arithmetic; the objects they point to may continue to be used after deallocation (dangling pointers); they may be used without having been initialized (wild pointers); or they may be directly assigned an unsafe value using a cast, union, or through another corrupt pointer. In general, C is permissive in allowing manipulation of and conversion between pointer types, although compilers typically provide options for various levels of checking. Some other programming languages address these problems by using more restrictive reference types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArray types in C are traditionally of a fixed, static size specified at compile time. The more recent C99 standard also allows a form of variable-length arrays. However, it is also possible to allocate a block of memory (of arbitrary size) at run-time, using the standard library\u0027s malloc function, and treat it as an array.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince arrays are always accessed (in effect) via pointers, array accesses are typically not checked against the underlying array size, although some compilers may provide bounds checking as an option.[38][39] Array bounds violations are therefore possible and can lead to various repercussions, including illegal memory accesses, corruption of data, buffer overruns, and run-time exceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC does not have a special provision for declaring multi-dimensional arrays, but rather relies on recursion within the type system to declare arrays of arrays, which effectively accomplishes the same thing. The index values of the resulting \"multi-dimensional array\" can be thought of as increasing in row-major order. Multi-dimensional arrays are commonly used in numerical algorithms (mainly from applied linear algebra) to store matrices. The structure of the C array is well suited to this particular task. However, in early versions of C the bounds of the array must be known fixed values or else explicitly passed to any subroutine that requires them, and dynamically sized arrays of arrays cannot be accessed using double indexing. (A workaround for this was to allocate the array with an additional \"row vector\" of pointers to the columns.) C99 introduced \"variable-length arrays\" which address this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following example using modern C (C99 or later) shows allocation of a two-dimensional array on the heap and the use of multi-dimensional array indexing for accesses (which can use bounds-checking on many C compilers):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here is a similar implementation using C99\u0027s Auto VLA feature:[c]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe subscript notation x[i] (where x designates a pointer) is syntactic sugar for *(x+i).[40] Taking advantage of the compiler\u0027s knowledge of the pointer type, the address that x + i points to is not the base address (pointed to by x) incremented by i bytes, but rather is defined to be the base address incremented by i multiplied by the size of an element that x points to. Thus, x[i] designates the i+1th element of the array.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, in most expression contexts (a notable exception is as operand of sizeof), an expression of array type is automatically converted to a pointer to the array\u0027s first element. This implies that an array is never copied as a whole when named as an argument to a function, but rather only the address of its first element is passed. Therefore, although function calls in C use pass-by-value semantics, arrays are in effect passed by reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe total size of an array x can be determined by applying sizeof to an expression of array type. The size of an element can be determined by applying the operator sizeof to any dereferenced element of an array A, as in n \u003d sizeof A[0]. Thus, the number of elements in a declared array A can be determined as sizeof A / sizeof A[0]. Note, that if only a pointer to the first element is available as it is often the case in C code because of the automatic conversion described above, the information about the full type of the array and its length are lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important functions of a programming language is to provide facilities for managing memory and the objects that are stored in memory. C provides three principal ways to allocate memory for objects:[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese three approaches are appropriate in different situations and have various trade-offs. For example, static memory allocation has little allocation overhead, automatic allocation may involve slightly more overhead, and dynamic memory allocation can potentially have a great deal of overhead for both allocation and deallocation. The persistent nature of static objects is useful for maintaining state information across function calls, automatic allocation is easy to use but stack space is typically much more limited and transient than either static memory or heap space, and dynamic memory allocation allows convenient allocation of objects whose size is known only at run-time. Most C programs make extensive use of all three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere possible, automatic or static allocation is usually simplest because the storage is managed by the compiler, freeing the programmer of the potentially error-prone chore of manually allocating and releasing storage. However, many data structures can change in size at runtime, and since static allocations (and automatic allocations before C99) must have a fixed size at compile-time, there are many situations in which dynamic allocation is necessary.[35] Prior to the C99 standard, variable-sized arrays were a common example of this. (See the article on malloc for an example of dynamically allocated arrays.) Unlike automatic allocation, which can fail at run time with uncontrolled consequences, the dynamic allocation functions return an indication (in the form of a null pointer value) when the required storage cannot be allocated. (Static allocation that is too large is usually detected by the linker or loader, before the program can even begin execution.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless otherwise specified, static objects contain zero or null pointer values upon program startup. Automatically and dynamically allocated objects are initialized only if an initial value is explicitly specified; otherwise they initially have indeterminate values (typically, whatever bit pattern happens to be present in the storage, which might not even represent a valid value for that type). If the program attempts to access an uninitialized value, the results are undefined. Many modern compilers try to detect and warn about this problem, but both false positives and false negatives can occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeap memory allocation has to be synchronized with its actual usage in any program to be reused as much as possible. For example, if the only pointer to a heap memory allocation goes out of scope or has its value overwritten before it is deallocated explicitly, then that memory cannot be recovered for later reuse and is essentially lost to the program, a phenomenon known as a memory leak. Conversely, it is possible for memory to be freed, but is referenced subsequently, leading to unpredictable results. Typically, the failure symptoms appear in a portion of the program unrelated to the code that causes the error, making it difficult to diagnose the failure. Such issues are ameliorated in languages with automatic garbage collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C programming language uses libraries as its primary method of extension. In C, a library is a set of functions contained within a single \"archive\" file. Each library typically has a header file, which contains the prototypes of the functions contained within the library that may be used by a program, and declarations of special data types and macro symbols used with these functions. In order for a program to use a library, it must include the library\u0027s header file, and the library must be linked with the program, which in many cases requires compiler flags (e.g., -lm, shorthand for \"link the math library\").[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common C library is the C standard library, which is specified by the ISO and ANSI C standards and comes with every C implementation (implementations which target limited environments such as embedded systems may provide only a subset of the standard library). This library supports stream input and output, memory allocation, mathematics, character strings, and time values. Several separate standard headers (for example, stdio.h) specify the interfaces for these and other standard library facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother common set of C library functions are those used by applications specifically targeted for Unix and Unix-like systems, especially functions which provide an interface to the kernel. These functions are detailed in various standards such as POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince many programs have been written in C, there are a wide variety of other libraries available. Libraries are often written in C because C compilers generate efficient object code; programmers then create interfaces to the library so that the routines can be used from higher-level languages like Java, Perl, and Python.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFile input and output (I/O) is not part of the C language itself but instead is handled by libraries (such as the C standard library) and their associated header files (e.g. stdio.h). File handling is generally implemented through high-level I/O which works through streams. A stream is from this perspective a data flow that is independent of devices, while a file is a concrete device. The high-level I/O is done through the association of a stream to a file. In the C standard library, a buffer (a memory area or queue) is temporarily used to store data before it is sent to the final destination. This reduces the time spent waiting for slower devices, for example a hard drive or solid state drive. Low-level I/O functions are not part of the standard C library[clarification needed] but are generally part of \"bare metal\" programming (programming that is independent of any operating system such as most embedded programming). With few exceptions, implementations include low-level I/O.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA number of tools have been developed to help C programmers find and fix statements with undefined behavior or possibly erroneous expressions, with greater rigor than that provided by the compiler. The tool lint was the first such, leading to many others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomated source code checking and auditing are beneficial in any language, and for C many such tools exist, such as Lint. A common practice is to use Lint to detect questionable code when a program is first written. Once a program passes Lint, it is then compiled using the C compiler. Also, many compilers can optionally warn about syntactically valid constructs that are likely to actually be errors. MISRA C is a proprietary set of guidelines to avoid such questionable code, developed for embedded systems.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also compilers, libraries, and operating system level mechanisms for performing actions that are not a standard part of C, such as bounds checking for arrays, detection of buffer overflow, serialization, dynamic memory tracking, and automatic garbage collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTools such as Purify or Valgrind and linking with libraries containing special versions of the memory allocation functions can help uncover runtime errors in memory usage.[42][43]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC is widely used for systems programming in implementing operating systems and embedded system applications.[44] This is for several reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC enables programmers to create efficient implementations of algorithms and data structures, because the layer of abstraction from hardware is thin, and its overhead is low, an important criterion for computationally intensive programs. For example, the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library, the GNU Scientific Library, Mathematica, and MATLAB are completely or partially written in C. Many languages support calling library functions in C, for example, the Python-based framework NumPy uses C for the high-performance and hardware-interacting aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC is sometimes used as an intermediate language by implementations of other languages. This approach may be used for portability or convenience; by using C as an intermediate language, additional machine-specific code generators are not necessary. C has some features, such as line-number preprocessor directives and optional superfluous commas at the end of initializer lists, that support compilation of generated code. However, some of C\u0027s shortcomings have prompted the development of other C-based languages specifically designed for use as intermediate languages, such as C--. Also, contemporary major compilers GCC and LLVM both feature an intermediate representation that is not C, and those compilers support front ends for many languages including C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA consequence of C\u0027s wide availability and efficiency is that compilers, libraries and interpreters of other programming languages are often implemented in C.[45] For example, the reference implementations of Python,[46] Perl,[47] Ruby,[48] and PHP[49] are written in C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, C was sometimes used for web development using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) as a \"gateway\" for information between the web application, the server, and the browser.[50] C may have been chosen over interpreted languages because of its speed, stability, and near-universal availability.[51] It is no longer common practice for web development to be done in C,[52] and many other web development tools exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC has also been widely used to implement end-user applications.[53] However, such applications can also be written in newer, higher-level languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe power of assembly language and the convenience of ... assembly language\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile C has been popular, influential and hugely successful, it has drawbacks, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some purposes, restricted styles of C have been adopted, e.g. MISRA C or CERT C, in an attempt to reduce the opportunity for bugs. Databases such as CWE attempt to count the ways C etc. has vulnerabilities, along with recommendations for mitigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are tools that can mitigate against some of the drawbacks. Contemporary C compilers include checks which may generate warnings to help identify many potential bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of these drawbacks have prompted the construction of other languages.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC has both directly and indirectly influenced many later languages such as C++ and Java.[61] The most pervasive influence has been syntactical; all of the languages mentioned combine the statement and (more or less recognizably) expression syntax of C with type systems, data models or large-scale program structures that differ from those of C, sometimes radically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral C or near-C interpreters exist, including Ch and CINT, which can also be used for scripting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen object-oriented programming languages became popular, C++ and Objective-C were two different extensions of C that provided object-oriented capabilities. Both languages were originally implemented as source-to-source compilers; source code was translated into C, and then compiled with a C compiler.[62]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C++ programming language (originally named \"C with Classes\") was devised by Bjarne Stroustrup as an approach to providing object-oriented functionality with a C-like syntax.[63] C++ adds greater typing strength, scoping, and other tools useful in object-oriented programming, and permits generic programming via templates. Nearly a superset of C, C++ now[when?] supports most of C, with a few exceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObjective-C was originally a very \"thin\" layer on top of C, and remains a strict superset of C that permits object-oriented programming using a hybrid dynamic/static typing paradigm. Objective-C derives its syntax from both C and Smalltalk: syntax that involves preprocessing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls is inherited from C, while the syntax for object-oriented features was originally taken from Smalltalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to C++ and Objective-C, Ch, Cilk, and Unified Parallel C are nearly supersets of C.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.coursera.org/courses?query\u003ddatabase","html":"\u003cp\u003eThe Database courses listed prepare learners for careers in data management, software engineering, and analytics, focusing on essential SQL skills, database design, and data integration to enhance technical proficiency and employability in the tech-driven market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe language used throughout the course, in both instruction and assessments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIBM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkills you\u0027ll gain: Cloud Computing, Computer Programming, Databases, Python Programming, SQL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4.6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(19K reviews)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeginner Â· Course Â· 1 -

Such compilation is not needed for speed, since Julia is also compiled when running interactively, but it can help with hiding source code. Features of the language can be separately compiled, so Julia can be used, for example, with its runtime or without it (which allows for smaller executables and libraries but is limited in capabilities).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia programs can reuse libraries from other languages by calling them, e.g. calling C or Rust libraries, and Julia (libraries) can also be called from other languages, e.g. Python and R, and several Julia packages have been made easily available from those languages, in the form of Python and R libraries for corresponding Julia packages. Calling in either direction has been implemented for many languages such as all of these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia\u0027s Visual Studio Code extension provides a fully-featured integrated development environment with support for debugging, linting, and profiling.[29][30][31][32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWork on Julia began in 2009, when Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman set out to create a free language that was both high-level and fast. On 14 February 2012, the team launched a website with a blog post explaining the language\u0027s mission.[33] In an interview with InfoWorld in April 2012, Karpinski said of the name \"Julia\": \"There\u0027s no good reason, really. It just seemed like a pretty name.\"[22] Bezanson said he chose the name on the recommendation of a friend,[34] then years later wrote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe julia stands for \"Jeff\u0027s uncommon lisp is automated\"?[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia\u0027s syntax is now considered stable, since version 1.0 in 2018, and Julia has a backward compatibility guarantee for 1.x and also a stability promise for the documented (stable) API, while in the years before in the early development prior to 0.7 the syntax (and semantics) was changed in new versions. All of the (registered package) ecosystem uses the new and improved syntax, and in most cases relies on new APIs that have been added regularly, and in some cases minor additional syntax added in a forward compatible way e.g. in Julia 1.7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 10 years since the 2012 launch of pre-1.0 Julia, the community has grown. The Julia package ecosystem has over 11.8 million lines of code (including docs and tests).[36] The JuliaCon academic conference for Julia users and developers has been held annually since 2014 with JuliaCon2020[37] welcoming over 28,900 unique viewers,[38] and then JuliaCon2021 breaking all previous records (with more than 300 JuliaCon2021 presentations available for free on YouTube, up from 162 the year before), and 43,000 unique viewers during the conference.[39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree of the Julia co-creators are the recipients of the 2019 James H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software (awarded every four years) \"for the creation of Julia, an innovative environment for the creation of high-performance tools that enable the analysis and solution of computational science problems.\"[40] Also, Alan Edelman, professor of applied mathematics at MIT, has been selected to receive the 2019 IEEE Computer Society Sidney Fernbach Award \"for outstanding breakthroughs in high-performance computing, linear algebra, and computational science and for contributions to the Julia programming language.\"[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Julia 0.7[42] and version 1.0 were released on 8 August 2018. Work on Julia 0.7 was a \"huge undertaking\" (e.g., because of an \"entirely new optimizer\"), and some changes were made to semantics, e.g. the iteration interface was simplified.[43]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia 1.6 was the largest release since 1.0, faster on many fronts, e.g. introduced parallel precompilation and faster loading of packages, in some cases \"50x speedup in load times for large trees of binary artifacts\".[44] As of version 1.7 Julia development is back to time-based releases.[45] Julia 1.7.0 was released in November 2021 with many changes, e.g. a new faster random-number generator. Julia 1.7.3 was released on 25 May 2022, fixing some issues, including at least one security update,[46] and 1.7.x is no longer supported. Julia 1.8 was released in 2022 (and versions up to 1.8.5 as a followup in January 2023,[47] both fixing bugs (backporting) and \"invalidations\", thus compiling faster), with improvements for distributing Julia programs without source code, and compiler speedup, in some cases by 25%,[48] and more controllable inlining (i.e. now also allowing applying @inline at the call site, not just on the function itself). Julia 1.9.0 was released on 7 May 2023 (and later 1.9.4, the latest stable version). It has many improvements, older releases have precompilation for packages, but they were not precompiled fully to native code until 1.9, leading to slower first use. Precompiled packages, since version 1.9, can be up to hundreds of times faster on first use (e.g. for CSV.jl and DataFrames.jl), and to improve precompilation of packages a new package PrecompileTools.jl has been introduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia 1.10.0 was released on 25 December 2023 (and Julia 1.10.3 update on 30 April 2024) with many new features, e.g. improved package load times and a new parser with better error messages and improved stacktrace rendering.[49]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2014,[50] the Julia Community has hosted an annual Julia Conference focused on developers and users. The first JuliaCon took place in Chicago and kickstarted the annual occurrence of the conference. Since 2014, the conference has taken place across a number of locations including MIT[51] and the University of Maryland, Baltimore.[52] The event audience has grown from a few dozen people to over 28,900 unique attendees[53] during JuliaCon 2020, which took place virtually. JuliaCon 2021 also took place virtually[54] with keynote addresses from professors William Kahan, the primary architect of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard (which virtually all CPUs and languages, including Julia, use),[55] Jan Vitek,[56] Xiaoye Sherry Li, and Soumith Chintala, a co-creator of PyTorch.[57] JuliaCon grew to 43,000 unique attendees and more than 300 presentations (still freely accessible, plus for older years). JuliaCon 2022 will also be virtual held between July 27 and July 29, 2022, for the first time in several languages, not just in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Julia language became a NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored project in 2014 in an effort to ensure the project\u0027s long-term sustainability.[58] Jeremy Kepner at MIT Lincoln Laboratory was the founding sponsor of the Julia project in its early days. In addition, funds from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Intel, and agencies such as NSF, DARPA, NIH, NASA, and FAA have been essential to the development of Julia.[59] Mozilla, the maker of Firefox web browser, with its research grants for H1 2019, sponsored \"a member of the official Julia team\" for the project \"Bringing Julia to the Browser\",[60] meaning to Firefox and other web browsers.[61][62][63][64] The Julia language is also supported by individual donors on GitHub.[65]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliaHub, Inc. was founded in 2015 as Julia Computing, Inc. by Viral B. Shah, Deepak Vinchhi, Alan Edelman, Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski and Keno Fischer.[66][67]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2017, Julia Computing raised US$4.6 million in seed funding from General Catalyst and Founder Collective,[68] the same month was \"granted $910,000 by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to support open-source Julia development, including $160,000 to promote diversity in the Julia community\",[69] and in December 2019 the company got $1.1 million funding from the US government to \"develop a neural component machine learning tool to reduce the total energy consumption of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings\".[70] In July 2021, Julia Computing announced they raised a $24 million Series A round led by Dorilton Ventures,[71] which also owns Formula 1 team Williams Racing, that partnered with Julia Computing. Williams\u0027 Commercial Director said: \"Investing in companies building best-in-class cloud technology is a strategic focus for Dorilton and Julia\u0027s versatile platform, with revolutionary capabilities in simulation and modelling, is hugely relevant to our business. We look forward to embedding Julia Computing in the world\u0027s most technologically advanced sport\".[72] In June 2023, JuliaHub received (again, now under its new name) a $13 million strategic new investment led by AE Industrial Partners HorizonX (\"AEI HorizonX\"). AEI HorizonX is a venture capital investment platform formed in partnership with The Boeing Company, which uses Julia.[73] Tim Holy\u0027s work (at Washington University in St. Louis\u0027s Holy Lab) on Julia 1.9 (improving responsiveness) was funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia is a general-purpose programming language,[74] while also originally designed for numerical/technical computing. It is also useful for low-level systems programming,[75] as a specification language,[76] high-level synthesis (HLS) tool (for hardware, e.g. FPGAs),[77] and for web programming[78] at both server[79][80] and client[81][82] side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main features of the language are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMultiple dispatch (also termed multimethods in Lisp) is a generalization of single dispatch â the polymorphic mechanism used in common object-oriented programming (OOP) languages, such as Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Smalltalk â that uses inheritance. In Julia, all concrete types are subtypes of abstract types, directly or indirectly subtypes of the Any type, which is the top of the type hierarchy. Concrete types can not themselves be subtyped the way they can in other languages; composition is used instead (see also inheritance vs subtyping).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy default, the Julia runtime must be pre-installed as user-provided source code is run. Alternatively, Julia (GUI) apps can be quickly bundled up into a single file with AppBundler.jl[83] for \"building Julia GUI applications in modern desktop application installer formats. It uses Snap for Linux, MSIX for Windows, and DMG for MacOS as targets. It bundles full Julia within the app\".[84] PackageCompiler.jl can build standalone executables that need no Julia source code to run.[26]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Julia, everything is an object, much like object-oriented languages; however, unlike most object-oriented languages, all functions use multiple dispatch to select methods, rather than single dispatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost programming paradigms can be implemented using Julia\u0027s homoiconic macros and packages. Julia\u0027s syntactic macros (used for metaprogramming), like Lisp macros, are more powerful than text-substitution macros used in the preprocessor of some other languages such as C, because they work at the level of abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Julia\u0027s macro system is hygienic, but also supports deliberate capture when desired (like for anaphoric macros) using the esc construct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia draws inspiration from various dialects of Lisp, including Scheme and Common Lisp, and it shares many features with Dylan, also a multiple-dispatch-oriented dynamic language (which features an ALGOL-like free-form infix syntax rather than a Lisp-like prefix syntax, while in Julia \"everything\"[85] is an expression), and with Fortress, another numerical programming language (which features multiple dispatch and a sophisticated parametric type system). While Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) adds multiple dispatch to Common Lisp, not all functions are generic functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Julia, Dylan, and Fortress, extensibility is the default, and the system\u0027s built-in functions are all generic and extensible. In Dylan, multiple dispatch is as fundamental as it is in Julia: all user-defined functions and even basic built-in operations like + are generic. Dylan\u0027s type system, however, does not fully support parametric types, which are more typical of the ML lineage of languages. By default, CLOS does not allow for dispatch on Common Lisp\u0027s parametric types; such extended dispatch semantics can only be added as an extension through the CLOS Metaobject Protocol. By convergent design, Fortress also features multiple dispatch on parametric types; unlike Julia, however, Fortress is statically rather than dynamically typed, with separate compiling and executing phases. The language features are summarized in the following table:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example of the extensibility of Julia, the Unitful.jl package adds support for physical units of measurement to the language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia has built-in support for calling C or Fortran language libraries using the @ccall macro. Additional libraries allow users to work with Python,[86] R,[87] C++,[88] Java,[89] and SQL.[90][91][92][93]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia can be compiled to binary executables with PackageCompiler.jl.[26] Smaller executables can also be written using a static subset of the language provided by StaticCompiler.jl that does not support runtime dispatch (nor garbage collection, since excludes the runtime that provides it).[94]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Julia official distribution includes an interactive command-line readâevalâprint loop (REPL),[95] with a searchable history, tab completion, and dedicated help and shell modes,[96] which can be used to experiment and test code quickly.[97] The following fragment represents a sample session example where strings are concatenated automatically by println:[98]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe REPL gives user access to the system shell and to help mode, by pressing ; or ? after the prompt (preceding each command), respectively. It also keeps the history of commands, including between sessions.[99] Code can be tested inside Julia\u0027s interactive session or saved into a file with a .jl extension and run from the command line by typing:[85]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia uses UTF-8 and LaTeX codes, allowing it to support common math symbols for many operators, such as â for the in operator, typable with \\in then pressing Tab â¹ (i.e. uses LaTeX codes, or also possible by simply copy-pasting, e.g. â and â possible for sqrt and cbrt functions). Julia has support for the latest major release Unicode 15.0 (Julia 1.11-DEV supports latest 15.1 point release[100])[101] for the languages of the world, even for source code, e.g. variable names (while it\u0027s recommened to use English for public code, and e.g. package names).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia is supported by Jupyter, an online interactive \"notebooks\" environment,[102] and Pluto.jl, a \"reactive notebook\" (where notebooks are saved as pure Julia files), a possible replacement for the former kind.[103] In addition Posit\u0027s (formerly RStudio Inc\u0027s) Quarto publishing system supports Julia, Python, R and Observable JavaScript (those languages have official support by the company, and can even be weaved together in the same notebook document, more languages are unofficially supported).[104][105]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe REPL can be extended with additional modes, and has been with packages, e.g. with an SQL mode,[106] for database access, and RCall.jl adds an R mode, to work with the R language.[107]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia is in practice interoperable with other languages (e.g. majority of top 10â20 languages in popular use). is used to call shared library functions individually (such as for written in C or Fortran), and packages are available to allow calling other languages (which do not provide C-exported functions directly) e.g. Python (with PythonCall.jl), R, MATLAB, C# (and other .NET languages with DotNET.jl, from them with JdotNET), JavaScript, Java (and other JVM languages, such as Scala with JavaCall.jl). And packages for other languages allow to call to Julia, e.g. from Python, R, Rust, Ruby, or C#. Such as with juliacall (part of PythonCall.jl, pyjulia is a different option) to call from Python and a different JuliaCall package for calling from R. Julia has also been used for hardware, i.e. to compile to VHDL, as a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool (for e.g. FPGAs).[77]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia has packages supporting markup languages such as HTML (and also for HTTP), XML, JSON and BSON, and for databases (such as PostgreSQL,[108] Mongo,[109] Oracle, including for TimesTen,[110] MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server,[109] Amazon Redshift, Vertica, ODBC) and web use in general.[111][112]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia has a built-in package manager and includes a default registry system.[113] Packages are most often distributed as source code hosted on GitHub, though alternatives can also be used just as well. Packages can also be installed as binaries, using artifacts.[114] Julia\u0027s package manager is used to query and compile packages, as well as managing environments. Federated package registries are supported, allowing registries other than the official to be added locally.[115]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia\u0027s core is implemented in Julia and C, together with C++ for the LLVM dependency. The code parsing, code-lowering, and bootstrapping were implemented in FemtoLisp, a Scheme dialect, up to version 1.10.[116] Since that version the new pure-Julia package JuliaSyntax.jl, is used for the parsing (while the old one can still be chosen)[117] which improves speed and \"greatly improves parser error messages in various cases\".[118] The LLVM compiler infrastructure project is used as the back end for generating optimized machine code for all commonly-used platforms. With some exceptions, the standard library is implemented in Julia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia has tier 1 macOS support, for 64-bit Apple Silicon Macs, natively (previously Apple M1-based Macs were only supported by running in Rosetta 2 emulation[119][120]), and also fully supports Intel-based Macs. Julia 1.6 LTS however does not fully support the Arm-based Macs (was then marked experimental), and that support got first upgraded to tier 2 with Julia 1.8, then to tier 1. Windows on ARM has no official support yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia has four support tiers.[121] All IA-32 processors completely implementing the i686 subarchitecture are supported and all 64-bit x86-64 (aka amd64), i.e. all less than about a decade old are supported. Armv8 (AArch64) processors are supported on second tier, and ARMv7 (AArch32) on third tier.[122] Hundreds of packages are GPU-accelerated:[123] CUDA (i.e. Nvidia GPUs; implementing PTX) has tier 1 support, with the help of an external package (and older versions of the package support down to CUDA 9). There are also additionally packages supporting other accelerators, such as Google\u0027s TPUs,[124] and some Intel (integrated) GPUs, through oneAPI.jl,[125] and AMD\u0027s GPUs have support with e.g. OpenCL; and experimental support for the AMD ROCm stack.[126]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn some platforms, Julia may need to be compiled from source code (e.g., the original Raspberry Pi), with specific build options, which has been done and unofficial pre-built binaries (and build instructions) are available.[127][128] Julia has been built for several ARM platforms, from small Raspberry Pis to (recent) top-1 supercomputer Fugaku\u0027s ARM-based A64FX.[129] PowerPC (64-bit) has tier 3 support, meaning it \"may or may not build\". Julia is now supported in Raspbian[130] while support is better for newer Pis, e.g., those with Armv7 or newer; the Julia support is promoted by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.[131]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Julia requires an operating system by default, and has no official support to run without or on embedded system platforms such as Arduino, Julia code has still been run on it, with some limitations, i.e. on a baremetal 16 MHz 8-bit (ATmega328P) AVR-microcontroller Arduino with 2 KB RAM (plus 32 KB of flash memory).[132][133]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia has been adopted at many universities including MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley and the University of Cape Town. Large private firms across many sectors have adopted the language including Amazon, IBM, JP Morgan AI Research,[134] and ASML. Julia has also been used by government agencies including NASA and the FAA, as well as every US national energy laboratory.[135][136]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia is widely used for drug development in the pharmaceutical industry, having been adopted by Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Procter \u0026 Gamble, and United Therapeutics.[156][157]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB","html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMATLAB (an abbreviation of \"MATrix LABoratory\"[21]) is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks.

Little. They decided to reprogram MATLAB in C and market it for the IBM desktops that were replacing mainframe computers at the time.[24] John Little and programmer Steve Bangert re-programmed MATLAB in C, created the MATLAB programming language, and developed features for toolboxes.[25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 1993 an open source alternative, GNU Octave (mostly compatible with matlab) and scilab (similar to matlab) have been available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMATLAB was first released as a commercial product in 1984 at the Automatic Control Conference in Las Vegas.[24][25] MathWorks, Inc. was founded to develop the software[29] and the MATLAB programming language was released.[27] The first MATLAB sale was the following year, when Nick Trefethen from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology bought ten copies.[25][32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of the 1980s, several hundred copies of MATLAB had been sold to universities for student use.[25] The software was popularized largely thanks to toolboxes created by experts in various fields for performing specialized mathematical tasks.[28] Many of the toolboxes were developed as a result of Stanford students that used MATLAB in academia, then brought the software with them to the private sector.[25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, MATLAB was re-written for early operating systems created by Digital Equipment Corporation, VAX, Sun Microsystems, and for Unix PCs.[25][27] Version 3 was released in 1987.[33] The first MATLAB compiler was developed by Stephen C. Johnson in the 1990s.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2000, MathWorks added a Fortran-based library for linear algebra in MATLAB 6, replacing the software\u0027s original LINPACK and EISPACK subroutines that were in C.[27] MATLAB\u0027s Parallel Computing Toolbox was released at the 2004 Supercomputing Conference and support for graphics processing units (GPUs) was added to it in 2010.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome especially large changes to the software were made with version 8 in 2012.[34] The user interface was reworked[citation needed] and Simulink\u0027s functionality was expanded.[35] By 2016, MATLAB had introduced several technical and user interface improvements, including the MATLAB Live Editor notebook, and other features.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MATLAB application is built around the MATLAB programming language. Common usage of the MATLAB application involves using the \"Command Window\" as an interactive mathematical shell or executing text files containing MATLAB code.[36]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example of a \"Hello, world!\" program exists in MATLAB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt displays like so:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVariables are defined using the assignment operator, \u003d. MATLAB is a weakly typed programming language because types are implicitly converted.[37] It is an inferred typed language because variables can be assigned without declaring their type, except if they are to be treated as symbolic objects,[38] and that their type can change. Values can come from constants, from computation involving values of other variables, or from the output of a function. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA simple array is defined using the colon syntax: initial:increment:terminator. For instance:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edefines a variable named array (or assigns a new value to an existing variable with the name array) which is an array consisting of the values 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. That is, the array starts at 1 (the initial value), increments with each step from the previous value by 2 (the increment value), and stops once it reaches (or is about to exceed) 9 (the terminator value).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe increment value can actually be left out of this syntax (along with one of the colons), to use a default value of 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eassigns to the variable named ari an array with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, since the default value of 1 is used as the increment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndexing is one-based,[39] which is the usual convention for matrices in mathematics, unlike zero-based indexing commonly used in other programming languages such as C, C++, and Java.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatrices can be defined by separating the elements of a row with blank space or comma and using a semicolon to separate the rows. The list of elements should be surrounded by square brackets []. Parentheses () are used to access elements and subarrays (they are also used to denote a function argument list).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSets of indices can be specified by expressions such as 2:4, which evaluates to [2, 3, 4]. For example, a submatrix taken from rows 2 through 4 and columns 3 through 4 can be written as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA square identity matrix of size n can be generated using the function eye, and matrices of any size with zeros or ones can be generated with the functions zeros and ones, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransposing a vector or a matrix is done either by the function transpose or by adding dot-prime after the matrix (without the dot, prime will perform conjugate transpose for complex arrays):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost functions accept arrays as input and operate element-wise on each element. For example, mod(2*J,n) will multiply every element in J by 2, and then reduce each element modulo n. MATLAB does include standard for and while loops, but (as in other similar applications such as APL and R), using the vectorized notation is encouraged and is often faster to execute. The following code, excerpted from the function magic.m, creates a magic square M for odd values of n (MATLAB function meshgrid is used here to generate square matrices I and J containing 1 : n {\\displaystyle 1:n} ):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMATLAB supports structure data types.[40] Since all variables in MATLAB are arrays, a more adequate name is \"structure array\", where each element of the array has the same field names. In addition, MATLAB supports dynamic field names[41] (field look-ups by name, field manipulations, etc.).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen creating a MATLAB function, the name of the file should match the name of the first function in the file. Valid function names begin with an alphabetic character, and can contain letters, numbers, or underscores. Variables and functions are case sensitive.[42]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMATLAB supports elements of lambda calculus by introducing function handles,[43] or function references, which are implemented either in .m files or anonymous[44]/nested functions.[45]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMATLAB supports object-oriented programming including classes, inheritance, virtual dispatch, packages, pass-by-value semantics, and pass-by-reference semantics.[46] However, the syntax and calling conventions are significantly different from other languages. MATLAB has value classes and reference classes, depending on whether the class has handle as a super-class (for reference classes) or not (for value classes).[47]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMethod call behavior is different between value and reference classes. For example, a call to a method:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan alter any member of object only if object is an instance of a reference class, otherwise value class methods must return a new instance if it needs to modify the object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example of a simple class is provided below:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen put into a file named hello.m, this can be executed with the following commands:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMATLAB has tightly integrated graph-plotting features. For example, the function plot can be used to produce a graph from two vectors x and y. The code:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eproduces the following figure of the sine function:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMATLAB supports three-dimensional graphics as well:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMATLAB supports developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications.[48] UIs can be generated either programmatically or using visual design environments such as GUIDE and App Designer.[49][50]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMATLAB can call functions and subroutines written in the programming languages C or Fortran.[51] A wrapper function is created allowing MATLAB data types to be passed and returned. MEX files (MATLAB executables) are the dynamically loadable object files created by compiling such functions.[52][53] Since 2014 increasing two-way interfacing with Python was being added.[54][55]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLibraries written in Perl, Java, ActiveX or .NET can be directly called from MATLAB,[56][57] and many MATLAB libraries (for example XML or SQL support) are implemented as wrappers around Java or ActiveX libraries. Calling MATLAB from Java is more complicated, but can be done with a MATLAB toolbox[58] which is sold separately by MathWorks, or using an undocumented mechanism called JMI (Java-to-MATLAB Interface),[59][60] (which should not be confused with the unrelated Java Metadata Interface that is also called JMI). Official MATLAB API for Java was added in 2016.[61]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs alternatives to the MuPAD based Symbolic Math Toolbox available from MathWorks, MATLAB can be connected to Maple or Mathematica.[62][63]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLibraries also exist to import and export MathML.[64]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2020, MATLAB withdrew services from two Chinese universities as a result of US sanctions. The universities said this will be responded to by increased use of open-source alternatives and by developing domestic alternatives.[65]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMATLAB is updated twice per year.[66]:â517â[35] In addition to new features and other improvements, each release has new bug fixes and smaller changes.[67]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epivot Function: Summarize tabular data in pivot tables; Python Interface: Support for conversions of Python and NumPy data types; use Python objects as keys in a MATLAB dictionary; Unit Testing Framework: Run tests using the Test browser; Java Interface: Support for Java 11 JDK and JRE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe number (or release number) is the version reported by Concurrent License Manager program FLEXlm.

Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNode.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don\u0027t have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo run this snippet, save it as a server.js file and run node server.js in your terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis code first includes the Node.js http module.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNode.js has a fantastic standard library, including first-class support for networking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe createServer() method of http creates a new HTTP server and returns it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe server is set to listen on the specified port and host name. When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing us that the server is running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever a new request is received, the request event is called, providing two objects: a request (an http.IncomingMessage object) and a response (an http.ServerResponse object).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first provides the request details. In this simple example, this is not used, but you could access the request headers and request data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second is used to return data to the caller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe set the statusCode property to 200, to indicate a successful response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe set the Content-Type header:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand we close the response, adding the content as an argument to end():\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee https://github.com/nodejs/examples for a list of Node.js examples that go beyond hello world.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://twitter.com/pycharm?ref_src\u003dtwsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor","html":"\u003cp\u003eWeâve detected that JavaScript is disabled in this browser.

Against clearly made agreements, Joost was filmed when he had just gotten off stage and had to rush to the greenroom. At that moment, Joost repeatedly indicated that he did not want to be filmed. This wasn\u0027t respected. This led to a threatening movement from Joost towards the camera. Joost did not touch the camerawoman. This incident was reported, followed by an investigation by the EBU and the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday and today we consulted extensively with the EBU and proposed several solutions. Nevertheless, the EBU has still decided to disqualify Joost Klein. AVROTROS finds the penalty very heavy and disproportionate. We stand for good manners - let there be no misunderstanding about that - but in our view, an exclusion order is not proportional to this incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are very disappointed and upset for the millions of fans who were so excited for tonight. What Joost brought to the Netherlands and Europe shouldn\u0027t have ended this way\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, a petition linking Joost\u0027s disqualification to the Palestinian cause has now reached over 36,000 signatories according to NOS\u0027s livefeed, despite repeated statements that Joost\u0027s incident is unrelated to the Israeli delegation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpdate: 18:17CEST\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEBU Director General Noel Curran has spoken to SVT about this incident, saying the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I hope people understand that when you have a police investigation, it\u0027s important that I don\u0027t prejudge the outcome of it\u0027.

Look guys, I never wear a tie, but now I have my Europapa - that\u0027s still a bit of Europapa joy in the hall. So I\u0027m going to the hall with mixed feelings with Jaqueline because I\u0027m still doing commentary at the urgent request of AVROTROS. You could have chosen not to do it, but well, we also believe that justice must be done to all those other artists with their stories, which are also important for Europe, for the Netherlands, like Joost who also deserved those stories and deserved that attention tonight. So that\u0027s why we\u0027re still going to do it. And it will also be broadcasted, because it\u0027s a contractual obligation for AVROTROS, also with an eye on the future, how it will go afterwards. I have no idea. I mean, the statement from AVROTROS is out now, maybe Joost will also make a statement, that\u0027s not clear yet. But I do notice from all the reactions that everyone finds it scandalous and disproportionate. That\u0027s exactly what I think, so I\u0027m frankly quite angry about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What measures has AVROTROS indicated that could happen other than disqualification?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, they\u0027ve indicated all sorts of things, discussed things. Joost was harassed several times by this lady with a running camera and he didn\u0027t want that to happen after he had sung the emotional part of his song where he really gets into it every time. Because that\u0027s the kind of artist he is. He experiences or re-experiences that every time anew. That may be different for other artists, but for him, that\u0027s how it is. So then he comes off stage - there was a moment a week ago when he had already indicated that he didn\u0027t want that. There had already been a bit of a fuss about it and yet it happened again, another time. So as far as I know, but again, as far as I know because I wasn\u0027t there (!!!), he pushed her camera or phone down, I believe, and that was about it. And the EBU - everyone in the management also thought after all the previous discussions that it would be okay. That\u0027s how we all went to bed last night. So everyone was totally in shock this morning when it turned out that the EBU didn\u0027t want to reverse the decision after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I\u0027m getting reactions from a lot of other commentators, of course, from artists too. [name of someone I don\u0027t know] also said \"I think you guys are going to skip a year\". We haven\u0027t even talked about that at all. But it will have consequences, because at some point, it will really come out what it all entailed and then everyone will realize that it amounted to nothing. And I mean, the EBU also makes other decisions that are on a much more sensitive level, and that\u0027s all fine, and now they\u0027re making such a big deal out of this. For a broadcaster that organized the Eurovision Song Contest so fantastically less than three years ago, with a head of delegation who has worked so hard in recent years for everything Eurovision stands for. I would almost say \"Fuck the EBU\", but I\u0027m saying that now anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople asking \"How is Joost doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea and I have to (go) now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterruption and more people asking questions. \"Where is Joost right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know where he is. I really don\u0027t know, sorry. No, I haven\u0027t spoken to him, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have footage of the incident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I don\u0027t at least. I didn\u0027t see anything. I don\u0027t know. People have been questioned and further - that\u0027s actually - also there - as a result of the interrogations, it turned out yesterday that - everyone thought well it\u0027s okay. It\u0027s actually a tiny story, but -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why is this such a big deal for the EBU? Any idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, stubbornness, I think. Rules are rules. They really have a zero-tolerance policy towards what could potentially be crossing boundaries.

She promised to never make a \"go bag\" again. Honestly the previous post has been eye opening to me. People here called me an abuser when I never did anything to abusive. I read every comment posted here, on other subreddits, and it seems like people will call me abuser no matter what. Some people even made up stories to paint me in bad light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems that general sentiment is that its okay to mistrust men because statistics and if he complains about it, he is potentially an abuser. Why is it wrong to want to be trusted by your own wife? If I made her get rid of her \"go bag\", I am as good as an abuser in all of your eyes. It seems like I will be painted as an abuser unless proven otherwise. I just dont know how to prove a negative, its not like I can wear a camera all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially my feelings were very hurt but now I am realizing the gravity of situation I am in. I just cant risk my future on a wife who does not trust me because her mere act of making a go bag was used by people here to paint me as an abuser. They said that she must have reason to make a \"go bag\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow was it my fault that she read some blogs and decided to do it. I never did anything and yet people are just gonna accuse me even if I didnt do anything. You guys dont care what the truth is so what am I even supposed to do? My only choice is to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have finally moved out yesterday and I am pushing forward with divorce.

Swift compiles to machine code, as it is an LLVM-based compiler. Swift was first released in June 2014,[11] and the Swift toolchain has shipped in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming, and similar features, but in a \"safer\" way, making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term \"protocol-oriented programming\"[12] (similar to traits and type classes).[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift was introduced at Apple\u0027s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).[14] It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple\u0027s platforms and Linux.[15][16]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough version 3.0 the syntax of Swift went through significant evolution, with the core team making source stability a focus in later versions.[17][18] In the first quarter of 2018 Swift surpassed Objective-C in measured popularity.[19]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift 4.0, released in 2017, introduced several changes to some built-in classes and structures. Code written with previous versions of Swift can be updated using the migration functionality built into Xcode. Swift 5, released in March 2019, introduced a stable binary interface on Apple platforms, allowing the Swift runtime to be incorporated into Apple operating systems. It is source compatible with Swift 4.[20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift 5.1 was officially released in September 2019. Swift 5.1 builds on the previous version of Swift 5 by extending the stable features of the language to compile-time with the introduction of module stability. The introduction of module stability makes it possible to create and share binary frameworks that will work with future releases of Swift.[21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift 5.5, officially announced by Apple at the 2021 WWDC, significantly expands language support for concurrency and asynchronous code, notably introducing a unique version of the actor model.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift 5.9, was released in September 2023 and includes a macro system, generic parameter packs, and ownership features like the new consume operator.[23]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current version, Swift 5.10, was released in March 2024. This version improves the language\u0027s concurrency model, allowing for full data isolation to prevent data races. It is also the last release before Swift 6.[24] Version 5.10 is currently available for macOS, Windows and, in experimental use, for Linux.[25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevelopment of Swift started in July 2010 by Chris Lattner, with the eventual collaboration of many other programmers at Apple. Swift was motivated by the need for a replacement for Apple\u0027s earlier programming language Objective-C, which had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift took language ideas \"from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list\".[7] On June 2, 2014, the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) application became the first publicly released app written with Swift.[26] A beta version of the programming language was released to registered Apple developers at the conference, but the company did not promise that the final version of Swift would be source code compatible with the test version. Apple planned to make source code converters available if needed for the full release.[26]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Swift Programming Language, a free 500-page manual, was also released at WWDC, and is available on the Apple Books Store and the official website.[27]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift reached the 1.0 milestone on September 9, 2014, with the Gold Master of Xcode 6.0 for iOS.[28] Swift 1.1 was released on October 22, 2014, alongside the launch of Xcode 6.1.[29] Swift 1.2 was released on April 8, 2015, along with Xcode 6.3.[30] Swift 2.0 was announced at WWDC 2015, and was made available for publishing apps in the App Store on September 21, 2015.[31] Swift 3.0 was released on September 13, 2016.[32] Swift 4.0 was released on September 19, 2017.[33] Swift 4.1 was released on March 29, 2018.[34]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift won first place for Most Loved Programming Language in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2015[35] and second place in 2016.[36]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn December 3, 2015, the Swift language, supporting libraries, debugger, and package manager were open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license with a Runtime Library Exception,[37] and Swift.org was created to host the project. The source code is hosted on GitHub, where it is easy for anyone to get the code, build it themselves, and even create pull requests to contribute code back to the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn December 2015, IBM announced its Swift Sandbox website, which allows developers to write Swift code in one pane and display output in another.[38][39][40] The Swift Sandbox was deprecated in January 2018.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the WWDC 2016, Apple announced an iPad exclusive app, named Swift Playgrounds, intended to teach people how to code in Swift. The app is presented in a 3D video game-like interface which provides feedback when lines of code are placed in a certain order and executed.[42][43][44]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January 2017, Chris Lattner announced his departure from Apple for a new position with Tesla Motors, with the Swift project lead role going to team veteran Ted Kremenek.[45][46]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring WWDC 2019, Apple announced SwiftUI with Xcode 11, which provides a framework for declarative UI structure design across all Apple platforms.[47]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficial downloads for the Ubuntu distribution of Linux have been available since Swift 2.2, with more distros added since Swift 5.2.4, CentOS and Amazon Linux.[48] There is an unofficial SDK and native toolchain package for Android too.[49][50]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe platforms Swift supports are Apple\u0027s operating systems (Darwin, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS), Linux, Windows, and Android.[51][52]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key aspect of Swift\u0027s design is its ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades, such as Cocoa and the Cocoa Touch frameworks. On Apple platforms,[53] it links with the Objective-C runtime library, which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.[54]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift is a general purpose programming language that employs modern programming-language theory concepts and strives to present a simple, yet powerful syntax. Swift incorporates innovations and conventions from various programming languages, with notable inspiration from Objective-C, which it replaced as the primary development language on Apple Platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift was designed to be safe and friendly to new programmers while not sacrificing speed. By default Swift manages all memory automatically and ensures variables are always initialized before use. Array accesses are checked for out-of-bounds errors and integer operations are checked for overflow. Parameter names allow creating clear APIs. Protocols define interfaces that types may adopt, while extensions allow developers to add more function to existing types. Swift enables object-oriented programming with the support for classes, subtyping, and method overriding. Optionals allow nil values to be handled explicitly and safely. Concurrent programs can be written using async/await syntax and actors isolate shared mutable state in order to eliminate data races.[69][70]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift\u0027s syntax is similar to C-style languages. Code begins executing in the global scope by default.[71] Alternatively, the @main attribute can be applied a structure, class, or enumeration declaration to indicate that it contains the program\u0027s entry point.[72]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift\u0027s \"Hello, World!\" program is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe print(_:separator:terminator:) function used here is included in Swift\u0027s standard library, which is available to all programs without the need to import external modules. Statements in Swift don\u0027t have to end with a semicolon, however semicolons are required to separate multiple statements written on the same line. Single-line comments begin with // and continue until the end of the current line. Multiline comments are contained by /* and */ characters. Constants are declared with the let keyword and variables with the var keyword. Values must be initialized before they are read. Values may infer their type based on the type of the provided initial value. If the initial value is set after the value\u0027s declaration, a type must be declared explicitly.[71]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eControl flow in Swift is managed with if-else, guard, and switch statements, along with while and for-in loops. If statements take a boolean parameter and execute the body of the if statement if the condition is true, otherwise it executes the optional else body. if-let syntax provides syntactic sugar for checking for the existence of an optional value and unwrapping it at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunctions are defined with the func keyword. Function parameters may have names which allow function calls to read like phrases. An underscore before the parameter name allows the argument label to be omitted from the call site. Tuples can be used by functions to return multiple pieces of data at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunctions, and anonymous functions known as closures, can be assigned to properties and passed around the program like any other value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eguard statements require that the given condition is true before continuing on past the guard statement, otherwise the body of the provided else clause is run. The else clause must exit control of the code block in which the guard statement appears. guard statements are useful for ensuring that certain requirements are met before continuing on with program execution. In particular they can be used to create an unwrapped version of an optional value that is guaranteed to be non-nil for the remainder of the enclosing scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eswitch statements compare a value with multiple potential values and then executes an associated code block. switch statements must be made exhaustive, either by including cases for all possible values or by including a default case which is run when the provided value doesn\u0027t match any of the other cases. switch cases do not implicitly fall through, although they may explicitly do so with the fallthrough keyword. Pattern matching can be used in various ways inside switch statements. Here is an example of an integer being matched against a number of potential ranges:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor-in loops iterate over a sequence of values:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhile loops iterate as long as the given boolean condition evaluates to true:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift supports closures, which are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in code,[73] and can also be used as anonymous functions. Here are some examples:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosures can be assigned to variables and constants, and can be passed into other functions or closures as parameters. Single-expression closures may drop the return keyword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift also has a trailing closure syntax, which allows the closure to be written after the end of the function call instead of within the function\u0027s parameter list. Parentheses can be omitted altogether if the closure is the function\u0027s only parameter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting from version 5.3, Swift supports multiple trailing closures:[74]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift will provide shorthand argument names for inline closures, removing the need to explicitly name all of the closures parameters.[75] Arguments can be referred to with the names $0, $1, $2, and so on:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosures may capture values from their surrounding scope. The closure will refer to this captured value for as long as the closure exists:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Swift standard library includes unicode-compliant String and Character types. String values can be initialized with a String literal, a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotation marks. Strings can be concatenated with the + operator:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eString interpolation allows for the creation of a new string from other values and expressions. Values written between parentheses preceded by a \\ will be inserted into the enclosing string literal:[76]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA for-in loop can be used to iterate over the characters contained in a string:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Foundation framework is imported Swift invisibly bridges the String type to NSString, the String class commonly used in Objective-C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Swift, callable objects are defined using callAsFunction.[77]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift supports five access control levels for symbols: open, public, internal, fileprivate, and private. Unlike many object-oriented languages, these access controls ignore inheritance hierarchies: private indicates that a symbol is accessible only in the immediate scope, fileprivate indicates it is accessible only from within the file, internal indicates it is accessible within the containing module, public indicates it is accessible from any module, and open (only for classes and their methods) indicates that the class may be subclassed outside of the module.[78]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn important feature in Swift is option types, which allow references or values to operate in a manner similar to the common pattern in C, where a pointer may either refer to a specific value or no value at all. This implies that non-optional types cannot result in a null-pointer error; the compiler can ensure this is not possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOptional types are created with the Optional enum. To make an Integer that is nullable, one would use a declaration similar to var optionalInteger: Optional\u003cInt\u003e. As in C#,[79] Swift also includes syntactic sugar for this, allowing one to indicate a variable is optional by placing a question mark after the type name, var optionalInteger: Int?.[80] Variables or constants that are marked optional either have a value of the underlying type or are nil. Optional types wrap the base type, resulting in a different instance. String and String? are fundamentally different types, the former is of type String while the latter is an Optional that may be holding some String value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo access the value inside, assuming it is not nil, it must be unwrapped to expose the instance inside. This is performed with the ! operator:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, the ! operator unwraps anOptionalInstance to expose the instance inside, allowing the method call to be made on it. If anOptionalInstance is nil, a null-pointer error occurs, terminating the program. This is known as force unwrapping. Optionals may be safely unwrapped using optional chaining which first tests whether the instance is nil, and then unwrap it if it is non-null:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case the runtime calls someMethod only if anOptionalInstance is not nil, suppressing the error. A ? must be placed after every optional property. If any of these properties are nil the entire expression evaluates as nil. The origin of the term chaining comes from the more common case where several method calls/getters are chained together. For instance:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan be reduced to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift\u0027s use of optionals allows the compiler to use static dispatch because the unwrapping action is called on a defined instance (the wrapper), versus occurring in a runtime dispatch system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many object-oriented languages, objects are represented internally in two parts. The object is stored as a block of data placed on the heap, while the name (or \"handle\") to that object is represented by a pointer. Objects are passed between methods by copying the value of the pointer, allowing the same underlying data on the heap to be accessed by anyone with a copy. In contrast, basic types like integers and floating-point values are represented directly; the handle contains the data, not a pointer to it, and that data is passed directly to methods by copying. These styles of access are termed pass-by-reference in the case of objects, and pass-by-value for basic types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth concepts have their advantages and disadvantages. Objects are useful when the data is large, like the description of a window or the contents of a document. In these cases, access to that data is provided by copying a 32- or 64-bit value, versus copying an entire data structure. However, smaller values like integers are the same size as pointers (typically both are one word), so there is no advantage to passing a pointer, versus passing the value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift offers built-in support for objects using either pass-by-reference or pass-by-value semantics, the former using the class declaration and the latter using struct. Structs in Swift have almost all the same features as classes: methods, implementing protocols and using the extension mechanisms. For this reason, Apple terms all data generically as instances, versus objects or values. Structs do not support inheritance, however.[81]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe programmer is free to choose which semantics are more appropriate for each data structure in the application. Larger structures like windows would be defined as classes, allowing them to be passed around as pointers. Smaller structures, like a 2D point, can be defined as structs, which will be pass-by-value and allow direct access to their internal data with no indirection or reference counting. The performance improvement inherent to the pass-by-value concept is such that Swift uses these types for almost all common data types, including Int and Double, and types normally represented by objects, like String and Array.[81] Using value types can result in significant performance improvements in user applications as well.[82]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArray, Dictionary, and Set all utilize copy on write so that their data are copied only if and when the program attempts to change a value in them. This means that the various accessors have what is in effect a pointer to the same data storage. So while the data is physically stored as one instance in memory, at the level of the application, these values are separate and physical separation is enforced by copy on write only if needed.[83]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtensions add new functionality to an existing type, without the need to subclass or even have access to the original source code. Extensions can add new methods, initializers, computed properties, subscripts, and protocol conformances.[84] An example might be to add a spell checker to the base String type, which means all instances of String in the program gain the ability to spell-check. The system is also widely used as an organizational technique, allowing related code to be gathered into library-like extensions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtensions are declared with the extension keyword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtocols promise that a particular type implements a set of methods or properties, meaning that other instances in the system can call those methods on any instance implementing that protocol. This is often used in modern object-oriented languages as a substitute for multiple inheritance, although the feature sets are not entirely similar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Objective-C, and most other languages implementing the protocol concept, it is up to the programmer to ensure that the required methods are implemented in each class.[85] Swift adds the ability to add these methods using extensions, and to use generic programming (generics) to implement them. Combined, these allow protocols to be written once and support a wide variety of instances. Also, the extension mechanism can be used to add protocol conformance to an object that does not list that protocol in its definition.[86]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, a protocol might be declared called Printable, which ensures that instances that conform to the protocol implement a description property and a printDetails() method requirement:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis protocol can now be adopted by other types:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtensions can be used to add protocol conformance to types. Protocols themselves can also be extended to provide default implementations of their requirements. Adopters may define their own implementations, or they may use the default implementation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Swift, like many modern languages supporting interfaces, protocols can be used as types, which means variables and methods can be defined by protocol instead of their specific type:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt does not matter what concrete type of someSortOfPrintableInstance is, the compiler will ensure that it conforms to the protocol and thus this code is safe. This syntax also means that collections can be based on protocols also, like let printableArray \u003d [any Printable].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth extensions and protocols are used extensively in Swift\u0027s standard library; in Swift 5.9, approximately 1.2 percent of all symbols within the standard library were protocols, and another 12.3 percent were protocol requirements or default implementations.[87] For instance, Swift uses extensions to add the Equatable protocol to many of their basic types, like Strings and Arrays, allowing them to be compared with the \u003d\u003d operator. The Equatable protocol also defines this default implementation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis function defines a method that works on any instance conforming to Equatable, providing a not equals operator. Any instance, class or struct, automatically gains this implementation simply by conforming to Equatable.[88]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtocols, extensions, and generics can be combined to create sophisticated APIs. For example, constraints allow types to conditionally adopt protocols or methods based on the characteristics of the adopting type. A common use case may be adding a method on collection types only when the elements contained within the collection are Equatable:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift 5.5 introduced structured concurrency into the language.[89] Structured concurrency uses Async/await syntax similar to Kotlin, JavaScript, and Rust. An async function is defined with the async keyword after the parameter list. When calling an async function the await keyword must be written before the function to indicate that execution will potentially suspend while calling function. While a function is suspended the program may run some other concurrent function in the same program. This syntax allows programs to clearly call out potential suspension points and avoid a version of the Pyramid of doom (programming) caused by the previously widespread use of closure callbacks.[90]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe async let syntax allows multiple functions to run in parallel. await is again used to mark the point at which the program will suspend to wait for the completion of the async functions called earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTasks and TaskGroups can be created explicitly to create a dynamic number of child tasks during runtime:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift uses the Actor model to isolate mutable state, allowing different tasks to mutate shared state in a safe manner. Actors are declared with the actor keyword and are reference types, like classes. Only one task may access the mutable state of an actor at the same time. Actors may access and mutate their own internal state freely, but code running in separate tasks must mark each access with the await keyword to indicate that the code may suspend until other tasks finish accessing the actor\u0027s state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Apple systems, Swift uses the same runtime as the extant Objective-C system, but requires iOS 7 or macOS 10.9 or higher. It also depends on Grand Central Dispatch.[91] Swift and Objective-C code can be used in one program, and by extension, C and C++ also. Beginning in Swift 5.9, C++ code can be used directly from Swift code.[92] In the case of Objective-C, Swift has considerable access to the object model, and can be used to subclass, extend and use Objective-C code to provide protocol support.[93] The converse is not true: a Swift class cannot be subclassed in Objective-C.[94]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo aid development of such programs, and the re-use of extant code, Xcode 6 and higher offers a semi-automated system that builds and maintains a bridging header to expose Objective-C code to Swift. This takes the form of an additional header file that simply defines or imports all of the Objective-C symbols that are needed by the project\u0027s Swift code. At that point, Swift can refer to the types, functions, and variables declared in those imports as though they were written in Swift. Objective-C code can also use Swift code directly, by importing an automatically maintained header file with Objective-C declarations of the project\u0027s Swift symbols. For instance, an Objective-C file in a mixed project called \"MyApp\" could access Swift classes or functions with the code #import \"MyApp-Swift.h\". Not all symbols are available through this mechanism, howeverâuse of Swift-specific features like generic types, non-object optional types, sophisticated enums, or even Unicode identifiers may render a symbol inaccessible from Objective-C.[95]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift also has limited support for attributes, metadata that is read by the development environment, and is not necessarily part of the compiled code. Like Objective-C, attributes use the @ syntax, but the currently available set is small. One example is the @IBOutlet attribute, which marks a given value in the code as an outlet, available for use within Interface Builder (IB). An outlet is a device that binds the value of the on-screen display to an object in code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn non-Apple systems, Swift does not depend on an Objective-C runtime or other Apple system libraries; a set of Swift \"Corelib\" implementations replace them. These include a \"swift-corelibs-foundation\" to stand in for the Foundation Kit, a \"swift-corelibs-libdispatch\" to stand in for the Grand Central Dispatch, and an \"swift-corelibs-xctest\" to stand in for the XCTest APIs from Xcode.[96]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of 2019, with Xcode 11, Apple has also added a major new UI paradigm called SwiftUI. SwiftUI replaces the older Interface Builder paradigm with a new declarative development paradigm.[97]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to manage memory. Every instance of a class or closure maintains a reference count which keeps a running tally of the number of references the program is holding for on to. When this count reaches 0 the instance is deallocated. This automatic deallocation removes the need for a garbage collector as instances are deallocated as soon as they are no longer needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strong reference cycle can occur if two instances each strongly reference each other (e.g. A references B, B references A). Since neither instances reference count can ever reach zero neither is ever deallocated, resulting in a memory leak. Swift provides the keywords weak and unowned to prevent strong reference cycles. These keywords allow an instance to be referenced without incrementing its reference count. weak references must be optional variables, since they can change and become nil.[98] Attempting to access an unowned value that has already been deallocated results in a runtime error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA closure within a class can also create a strong reference cycle by capturing self references. Self references to be treated as weak or unowned can be indicated using a capture list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key element of the Swift system is its ability to be cleanly debugged and run within the development environment, using a readâevalâprint loop (REPL), giving it interactive properties more in common with the scripting abilities of Python than traditional system programming languages. The REPL is further enhanced with playgrounds, interactive views running within the Xcode environment or Playgrounds app that respond to code or debugger changes on-the-fly.[99] Playgrounds allow programmers to add in Swift code along with markdown documentation. Programmers can step through code and add breakpoints using LLDB either in a console or an IDE like Xcode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift is considered a C family programming language and is similar to C in various ways:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also has similarities to Objective-C:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifferences from Objective-C include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Swift can run on Linux, it is sometimes also used as a server-side language.[103] Some web frameworks have already been developed, such as IBM\u0027s Kitura (now discontinued), Perfect and Vapor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn official \"Server APIs\" work group has also been started by Apple,[104] with members of the Swift developer community playing a central role.[105]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second free implementation of Swift that targets Cocoa, Microsoft\u0027s Common Language Infrastructure (.NET Framework, now .NET), and the Java and Android platform exists as part of the Elements Compiler from RemObjects Software.[106]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubsets of Swift have been ported to additional platforms, such as Arduino[107] and Mac OS 9.[108]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/","html":"\u003cp\u003eC++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.

Key aspects of back-end development include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn essential component of the architecture of a web application is a server or cloud instance. A cloud instance is a virtual server instance that can be accessed via the Internet and is created, delivered, and hosted on a public or private cloud. It functions as a physical server that may seamlessly move between various devices with ease or set up several instances on one server. It is therefore very dynamic, scalable, and economical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase management is crucial for storing, retrieving, and managing data in web applications. Various database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, play distinct roles in organizing and structuring data. Effective database management ensures the responsiveness and efficiency of data-driven web applications. There are 3 types of databases:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe choice of a database depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, performance considerations, and the specific use case of the application being developed.

APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgramming languages aimed at server execution, as opposed to client browser execution, are known as server-side languages. These programming languages are used in web development to perform operations including data processing, database interaction, and the creation of dynamic content that is delivered to the client\u0027s browser. A key element of server-side programming is server-side scripting, which allows the server to react to client requests in real time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome popular server-side languages are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImplementing security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.[6] It was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.[7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocker is a tool that is used to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments in isolation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.[8] Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.[6]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in public (see decentralized computing, distributed computing, and cloud computing) or private cloud.[10] When running on Linux, Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel (such as cgroups and kernel namespaces) and a union-capable file system (such as OverlayFS)[11] to allow containers to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.[12] Docker on macOS uses a Linux virtual machine to run the containers.[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously.[14] A 2018 analysis found that a typical Docker use case involves running eight containers per host, and that a quarter of analyzed organizations run 18 or more per host.[15] It can also be installed on a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi.[16]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Linux kernel\u0027s support for namespaces mostly[17] isolates an application\u0027s view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel\u0027s cgroups provide resource limiting for memory and CPU.[18] Since version 0.9, Docker includes its own component (called libcontainer) to use virtualization facilities provided directly by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC and systemd-nspawn.[19][9][10][20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation.[21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Docker software as a service offering consists of three components:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn illustrative example of a Dockerfile:[29]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocker Inc. was founded by Kamel Founadi, Solomon Hykes, and Sebastien Pahl[44] during the Y Combinator Summer 2010 startup incubator group and launched in 2011.[45] The startup was also one of the 12 startups in Founder\u0027s Den first cohort.[46] Hykes started the Docker project in France as an internal project within dotCloud, a platform-as-a-service company.[47]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocker debuted to the public in Santa Clara at PyCon in 2013.[48] It was released as open-source in March 2013.[21] At the time, it used LXC as its default execution environment. One year later, with the release of version 0.9, Docker replaced LXC with its own component, libcontainer, which was written in the Go programming language.[19][49]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, Docker created the Moby project [d] for open research and development.[50]\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://angularjs.org/","html":"\u003cp\u003eAngularJS support has officially ended as of January 2022. See what ending support means and read the end of life announcement. Visit angular.io for the actively supported Angular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther frameworks deal with HTMLâs shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. Neither of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs. Read on to find out how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData-binding is an automatic way of updating the view whenever the model changes, as well as updating the model whenever the view changes. This is awesome because it eliminates DOM manipulation from the list of things you have to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eControllers are the behavior behind the DOM elements. AngularJS lets you express the behavior in a clean readable form without the usual boilerplate of updating the DOM, registering callbacks or watching model changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike other frameworks, there is no need to inherit from proprietary types in order to wrap the model in accessors methods. AngularJS models are plain old JavaScript objects. This makes your code easy to test, maintain, reuse, and again free from boilerplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectives are a unique and powerful feature available in AngularJS. Directives let you invent new HTML syntax, specific to your application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe use directives to create reusable components. A component allows you to hide complex DOM structure, CSS, and behavior. This lets you focus either on what the application does or how the application looks separately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn important part of serious apps is localization. AngularJS\u0027s locale aware filters and stemming directives give you building blocks to make your application available in all locales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep link reflects where the user is in the app. This is useful so users can bookmark and email links to locations within the app. Round trip apps get this automatically, but AJAX apps by their nature do not. AngularJS combines the benefits of deep linking with desktop app-like behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClient-side form validation is an important part of a great user experience. AngularJS lets you declare the validation rules of the form without having to write JavaScript code. Write less code, go have beer sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS provides built-in services on top of XHR as well as various other backends using third party libraries. Promises further simplify your code by handling asynchronous return of data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dependency injection in AngularJS allows you to declaratively describe how your application is wired. This means that your application needs no main() method which is usually an unmaintainable mess. Dependency injection is also a core to AngularJS. This means that any component which does not fit your needs can easily be replaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngularJS was designed from ground up to be testable. It encourages behavior-view separation, comes pre-bundled with mocks, and takes full advantage of dependency injection.

Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGit also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allows teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each other\u0027s code. Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is a basic overview of how Git works:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a guest post from Matt Shelton at Nuance Healthcare. This is the first post in a series about his team moving from Subversion to Git, why they did it, and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we\u0027re moving to Git and we like git-flow. Now what? Let\u0027s test it all out! My team is great. They threw together a hit list of developer workflows in Confluence...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefinition: A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process discussed in Git Basics, the first module of this series. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopyright Â© 2024 Atlassian\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp#:~:text\u003dC%2B%2B%20is%20an%20object%2Doriented,be%20adapted%20to%20multiple%20platforms.","html":"\u003cp\u003eW3Schools offers a wide range of services and products for beginners and professionals, helping millions of people everyday to learn and master new skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoy our free tutorials like millions of other internet users since 1999\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplore our selection of references covering all popular coding languages\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate your own website with W3Schools Spaces - no setup required\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTest your skills with different exercises\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTest yourself with multiple choice questions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocument your knowledge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate a free W3Schools Account to Improve Your Learning Experience\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrack your learning progress at W3Schools and collect rewards\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecome a PLUS user and unlock powerful features (ad-free, hosting, support,..)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot sure where you want to start?

It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat excluding in Go which is present in other languages?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardware Limitations\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have observed that in a decade, the hardware and processing configuration is changing at a very slow rate. In 2004, P4 was having the clock speed of 3.0 GHz and now in 2018, Macbook pro has the clock speed of Approx (2.3Ghz v 2.66Ghz). To speed up, the functionality we use more processors, but using more processor the cost also increases. And due to this we use limited processors and using limited processor we have a heavy programming language whose threading takes more memory and slows down the performance of our system. Hence, to overcome such problem Golang has been designed in such a way that instead of using threading it uses Goroutine, which is similar to threading but consumes very less memory. Like threading consumes 1MB whereas Goroutine consumes 2KB of memory, hence at the same time, we can have millions of goroutine triggered. So the above-discussed point makes golang a strong language that handles concurrency like C++ and Java.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvantages and Disadvantages of Go Language\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvantages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisadvantages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome popular Applications developed in Go Language\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountry wise Companies which are currently using Go Language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeatures of go language\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.java.com/","html":"Couldn\u0027t Connect"},{"url":"https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/cloud/what-is-go-an-intro-to-googles-go-programming-language-aka-golang","html":"\u003cp\u003eSign in to Skills\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSign in to A Cloud Guru\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSign in to Flow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSign in to Skills\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSign in to A Cloud Guru\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSign in to Flow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is Go/Golang?

Learn this and more in our intro to Google\u0027s Go programming language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy William Boyd\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay 08, 2024 â¢ 7 Minute Read\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use almost any programming language in the cloud, but there are a few languages that stand out from the rest. Let\u0027s talk about one of those languages, Go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo is an open-source programming language focused on simplicity, reliability, and efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo was originally designed at Google in 2007. At the time, Google was growing quickly, and code being used to manage their infrastructure was also growing quickly in both size and complexity. Some Google cloud engineers began to feel that this large and complex codebase was slowing them down. So they decided that they needed a new programming language focused on simplicity and quick performance. Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson designed Go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo became an open-source project and was released publicly in 2012. It quickly gained a surprising level of popularity and has become one of the leading modern programming languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs the language called Go or Golang? Take it straight from the horse\u0027s Google\u0027s mouth here: the language is called \"Go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle says the \"Golang\" moniker came about due to the website, golang.org, which was selected because \"go.org was not available to us.\" As a result, some people use the \"Golang\" interchangeably with \"Go\" when referring to the programming language. (Not us, but you know . . . )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fairness though, Golang is much more Google-able than Go, which could refer to the strategy game or the cult-classic Doug Liman movie. Golang is also used as the Twitter tag for Go, #golang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo was originally built for programs related to networking and infrastructure. It was intended to replace popular high-performance server-side languages like Java and C++. Today, Go is used for a variety of applications:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Go really shines the most when it comes to infrastructure. Some of the most popular infrastructure tools today are written in Go â such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Prometheus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is Go so popular? There may be as many opinions on this as there are Go programmers, but two reasons really stand out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, Go is simple to learn and understand. A popular saying about Go is that you can read and digest the entire Go spec in an afternoon. Many developers who have dived into Go agree it\u0027s easy to pick up compared to other languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, Go is great when it comes to performance. It was designed for automation at a large scale so Go makes it relatively easy to write high-performing applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet the Cloud Dictionary of Pain Speaking cloud doesnât have to be hard. We analyzed millions of responses to ID the concepts that trip people up. Grab this cloud guide for succinct definitions of the most painful cloud terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Go is one of the most loved languages by developers who use it. Go\u0027s own 2020 developer survey seems to agree, with a 92% satisfaction rating by Go users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython is more than 30 years old, but it continues to grow in popularity. The design of the language has stood the test of time (despite some rough spots along the way). Today, Python and Go are two of the most popular and convenient-to-use programming languages out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython is a great object-oriented language, but you can also write programs in a functional programming style too. Of all the programming languages, you probably won\u0027t find one used by more non-programmers than Python. Its flexibility is one of the reasons Python is so popular. It can be used for everything from cleaning up files on your computers to web applications, serverless projects, teaching programming to kids, working on animation, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython and Go each offer their unique benefits, but there\u0027s no reason you can\u0027t and shouldn\u0027t learn to use both!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why should you learn Go? Go is easy. Many developers agree that Go is easy to get into. And its code is relatively easy to understand. Learning Go comes with a big payoff in terms of power and versatility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if you\u0027re interested in a programming language that can do a lot, has a great community, and is easy to learn, check out Go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck out ACG\u0027s System Tooling with Go course. It will teach you enough Go to be able to write your own tools. Youâll learn how to leverage Goâs robust standard library, third-party packages, and how to handle some of the most common tasks when writing tools/scripts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn faster. Move faster. Transform now with courses and real hands-on labs in AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo is an open-source programming language focused on simplicity, reliability, and efficiency. Go became an open-source project and was released publicly in 2012. It quickly gained a surprising level of popularity and has become one of the leading modern programming languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo was originally built for programs related to networking and infrastructure. It was intended to replace popular high-performance server-side languages like Java and C++. Today, Go is used for a variety of applications like cloud and server side applications, DevOps, command line tools and much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython and Go both have a simple syntax and first-party support from all major cloud providers. Both Go and Python are easy to get started with for beginners and are relatively easy to learn. There\u0027s debate over which is easier. Go is a simpler language and may be mastered more quickly, but some find getting started more difficult than Python, which takes longer to master as there\u0027s more to learn.

Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOOPs Concepts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Class:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. A class is like a blueprint for an object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Object:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having to know details of each otherâs data or code, it is sufficient to know the type of message accepted and type of response returned by the objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example âDogâ is a real-life Object, which has some characteristics like color, Breed, Bark, Sleep, and Eats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Data Abstraction:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation. Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of the car or applying brakes will stop the car, but he does not know about how on pressing the accelerator the speed is increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerator, brakes, etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Encapsulation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In Encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of their class in which they are declared. As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section, etc. The finance section handles all the financial transactions and keeps records of all the data related to finance. Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some reason an official from the finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name âsales sectionâ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Inheritance:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. When we write a class, we inherit properties from other classes. So when we create a class, we do not need to write all the properties and functions again and again, as these can be inherited from another class that possesses it. Inheritance allows the user to reuse the code whenever possible and reduce its redundancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. Polymorphism:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. For example, A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7. Dynamic Binding:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to the function call is decided at runtime. Dynamic binding means that the code associated with a given procedure call is not known until the time of the call at run time. Dynamic Method Binding One of the main advantages of inheritance is that some derived class D has all the members of its base class B. Once D is not hiding any of the public members of B, then an object of D can represent B in any context where a B could be used. This feature is known as subtype polymorphism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8. Message Passing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a form of communication used in object-oriented programming as well as parallel programming. Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to each other. A message for an object is a request for execution of a procedure and therefore will invoke a function in the receiving object that generates the desired results. Message passing involves specifying the name of the object, the name of the function, and the information to be sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do we need object-oriented programming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers","html":"\u003cp\u003ePublished: 9 May 2024 Contributors: Stephanie Susnjara, Ian Smalley\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers are executable units of software that package application code along with its libraries and dependencies. They allow code to run in any computing environment, whether it be desktop, traditional IT or cloud infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers take advantage of a form of operating system (OS) virtualization in which features of the OS kernel (for example, Linux namespaces and cgroups, Windows silos and job objects) can be used to isolate processes and control the amount of CPU, memory and disk that those processes can access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore portable and resource-efficient than virtual machines (VMs), containers have become the de facto compute units of modern cloud-native applications. Additionally, containers are critical to the underlying IT infrastructure that powers hybrid multicloud settingsâthe combination of on-premises, private cloud, public cloud and more than one cloud service from more than one cloud vendor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to a report from Business Research Insights1, the global container technology market was valued at USD 496.4 million in 2021 and is expected to reach USD 3123.42 million by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.8%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrategic application modernization is one key to transformational success that can boost annual revenue and lower maintenance and running costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubscribe to the IBM newsletter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne way to better understand a container is to examine how it differs from a traditional virtual machine (VM), which is a virtual representation or emulation of a physical computer. A VM is often referred to as a guest, while the physical machine it runs on is called the host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVirtualization technology makes VMs possible. A hypervisorâa small software layerâallocates physical computing resources (for example, processors, memory, storage) to each VM. It keeps each VM separate from others so they donât interfere with each other. Each VM then contains a guest OS and a virtual copy of the hardware that the OS requires to run, along with an application and its associated libraries and dependencies. VMware was one of the first to develop and commercialize virtualization technology based on hypervisors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of virtualizing the underlying hardware, container technology virtualizes the operating system (typically Linux) so each container contains only the application and its libraries, configuration files and dependencies. The absence of the guest OS is why containers are so lightweight and, thus, faster and more portable than VMs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers and virtual machines are not mutually exclusive. For instance, an organization might leverage both technologies by running containers in VMs to increase isolation and security and leverage already installed tools for automation, backup and monitoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a deeper look at this comparison, check out âContainers versus VMs: Whatâs the difference?â and watch the video:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary advantage of containers, especially as compared to a VM, is that they provide a level of abstraction that makes them lightweight and portable. Their primary benefits include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers share the machine OS kernel, eliminating the need for a full OS instance per application and making container files small and easy on resources. A containerâs smaller size, especially compared to a VM, means it can spin up quickly and better support cloud-native applications that scale horizontally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers carry all their dependencies with them, meaning that software can be written once and then run without needing to be re-configured across computing environments (for example, laptops, cloud and on-premises).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to a combination of their deployment portability and consistency across platforms and their small size, containers are an ideal fit for modern development and application patternsâsuch as DevOps, serverless and microservicesâthat are built by using regular code deployments in small increments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike VMs, containers enable developers and operators to improve CPU and memory utilization of physical machines. Containers go even further because they enable microservices architecture so that application components can be deployed and scaled more granularly. This is an attractive alternative to scaling up an entire monolithic application because a single component is struggling with its load.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers rely less on system resources, making them faster to manage and deploy than VMs. This feature helps save money and time on application deployment and optimizes time to market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an IBM survey, developers and IT executives reported many other container benefits. Check out the full report: Containers in the enterprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers depend on containerization, the packaging of software code with just the operating system (OS) and its relevant environment variables, configuration files, libraries and software dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result is a container image that runs on a container platform. A container image represents binary data that encapsulates an application and all its software dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainerization allows applications to be âwritten once and run anywhere,â providing portability, speeding the development process, preventing cloud vendor lock-in and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainerization and process isolation have existed for decades2. A historical moment in container development occurred in 1979 with the development of chroot, part of the Unix version 7 operating system. Chroot introduced the concept of process isolation by restricting an applicationâs file access to a specific directory (the root) and its children (or subprocesses).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother significant milestone occurred in 2008, when Linux containers (LXCs) were implemented in the LinuxÂ® kernel, fully enabling virtualization for a single instance of Linux. Over the years, technologies like FreeBSD jails and AIX Workload Partitions have offered similar operating system-level virtualization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile LXC remains a well-known runtime and is part of the Linux distribution and vendor-neutral project3, newer Linux kernel technologies are available. Ubuntu, a modern, open-source Linux operating system, also provides this capability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatch the video to dive deeper into containerization:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost developers look to 2013 as the start of the modern container era with the introduction of Docker. An open-source containerization software platform that functions as a platform as a service (PaaS), Docker enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocker uses the Linux kernel (the operating systemâs base component) and kernel features (like Cgroups and namespaces) to separate processes so they can run independently. Docker essentially takes an application and its dependencies and turns them into a virtual container that can run on any Windows, macOS or Linux-running computer system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocker is based on a client-server architecture, with Docker Engine serving as the underlying technology. Docker provides an image-based deployment model, making sharing apps simple across computing environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo clarify any confusion, the Docker container platform namesake also refers to Docker, Inc.4, which develops productivity tools built around its open-source containerization platform and the Docker open source ecosystem and community5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, Docker and other leaders in the container industry established The Open Container Initiative6 , part of the Linux Foundation, an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtime environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocker is the most widely utilized containerization tool, with an 82.84% market share7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOperating hundreds of thousands of containers across a system can become unmanageable and calls for an orchestration management solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThatâs where container orchestration comes in, allowing companies to manage large volumes throughout their lifestyle, providing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile other container orchestration platforms (for example, Apache Mesos, Nomad, Docker Swarm) exist, Kubernetes has become the industry standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKubernetes architecture consists of running clusters that allow containers to run across multiple machines and environments. Each cluster typically consists of worker nodes, which run the containerized applications, and control plan nodes, which control the cluster. The control plane acts as the orchestrator of the Kubernetes cluster. It includes several components: the API server (manages all interactions with Kubernetes), the control manager (handles all control processes), the cloud controller manager (the interface with the cloud providerâs API), and so forth. Worker nodes run containers using container runtimes like Docker. Pods, the smallest deployable units in a cluster, hold one or more app containers and share resources, such as storage and networking information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKubernetes enables developers and operators to declare the desired state of their overall container environment through YAML files. Then, Kubernetes does all the processing work of establishing and maintaining that state, with activities that include deploying a specified number of instances of a given application or workload, rebooting that application if it fails, load balancing, autoscaling, zero downtime deployments and more. Container orchestration with Kubernetes is also crucial to continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) or the DevOps pipelineâwhich would be impossible without automation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, Google donated Kubernetes to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)8, the open-source, vendor-neutral hub of cloud-native computing operated under the auspices of the Linux Foundation. Since then, Kubernetes has become the most widely used container orchestration tool for running container-based workloads worldwide. In a CNCF report9, Kubernetes is the second largest open-source project in the world (after Linux) and the primary container orchestration tool for 71% of Fortune 100 companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers as a service (CaaS) is a cloud computing service that allows developers to manage and deploy containerized applications. It gives businesses of all sizes access to portable, scalable cloud solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaaS provides a cloud-based platform where users can streamline container-based virtualization and container management processes. CaaS providers offer myriad features, including (but not limited to) container runtimes, orchestration layers and persistent storage management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS), CaaS is available from cloud service providers (for example, AWS, Google Cloud Services, IBM CloudÂ®, Microsoft Azure) through a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which allows users to pay only for the services they use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizations use containers to support the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers are small and lightweight, making them a good match for microservice architectures, where applications are constructed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe combination of microservices as an architecture and containers as a platform is a common foundation for many development and operations teams that embrace DevOps methodologies. For instance, containers support DevOps pipelines, including continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause containers can run consistently anywhereâacross laptops, on-premises and cloud environmentsâthey are an ideal underlying architecture for hybrid cloud and multicloud scenarios in which organizations operate across a mix of multiple public clouds in combination with their own data center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most common approaches to application modernization is containerizing applications in preparation for cloud migration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainerization (that is, Docker images orchestrated with Kubernetes) quickly enables DevOps pipelines to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) apps into cloud computing environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers also offer an efficient way to deploy and manage the large language models (LLMs) associated with generative AI, providing portability and scalability when used with orchestration tools. Moreover, changes made to the LLM can be quickly packaged into a new container image, expediting development and testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRead more about container use cases, applications and examples\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond Kubernetes, two of the most popular projects in the container ecosystem are Istio and Knative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs developers use containers to build and run microservices, management concerns go beyond the lifecycle considerations of individual containers and into the ways that large numbers of small servicesâoften referred to as a âservice meshââconnect with and relate to one another. Istio makes it easier for developers to manage the associated challenges with discovery, traffic, monitoring, security and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnative (pronounced âkay-nativeâ) is an open-source platform that provides an easy onramp to serverless computing, the cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of deploying an ongoing instance of code that sits idle while waiting for requests, serverless brings up the code as needed, scaling it up or down as demand fluctuates, and then takes down the code when not in use. Serverless prevents wasted computing capacity and power and reduces costs because you only pay to run the code when itâs running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince containers play a major role in software development and deployment across hybrid cloud landscapes, organizations need to ensure that their containerized workloads remain safe from external and internal security threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContainers can be deployed anywhere, which creates new attack surfaces surrounding the container-based environment. Vulnerable security areas include container images, image registries, container runtimes, container orchestration platforms and host operating systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start, enterprises need to integrate container security into their security policies and overall strategy. Such strategies must include security best practices along with cloud-based security software tools. This holistic approach should be designed to protect containerized applications and their underlying infrastructure throughout the entire container lifecycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBest security practices include a zero-trust strategy that assumes a complex networkâs security is always at risk of external and internal threats. Moreover, containers call for a DevSecOps approach.

The DBMS additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term \"database\" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmall databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComputer scientists may classify database management systems according to the database models that they support. Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFormally, a \"database\" refers to a set of related data accessed through the use of a \"database management system\" (DBMS), which is an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the close relationship between them, the term \"database\" is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the world of professional information technology, the term database is often used to refer to any collection of related data (such as a spreadsheet or a card index) as size and usage requirements typically necessitate use of a database management system.[1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExisting DBMSs provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be classified into four main functional groups:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth a database and its DBMS conform to the principles of a particular database model.[5] \"Database system\" refers collectively to the database model, database management system, and database.[6]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhysically, database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software.

Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large-volume transaction processing environments. DBMSs are found at the heart of most database applications. DBMSs may be built around a custom multitasking kernel with built-in networking support, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standard operating system to provide these functions.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince DBMSs comprise a significant market, computer and storage vendors often take into account DBMS requirements in their own development plans.[7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabases and DBMSs can be categorized according to the database model(s) that they support (such as relational or XML), the type(s) of computer they run on (from a server cluster to a mobile phone), the query language(s) used to access the database (such as SQL or XQuery), and their internal engineering, which affects performance, scalability, resilience, and security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases and their respective DBMSs have grown in orders of magnitude. These performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in the areas of processors, computer memory, computer storage, and computer networks. The concept of a database was made possible by the emergence of direct access storage media such as magnetic disks, which became widely available in the mid-1960s; earlier systems relied on sequential storage of data on magnetic tape. The subsequent development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure: navigational,[8] SQL/relational, and post-relational.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two main early navigational data models were the hierarchical model and the CODASYL model (network model). These were characterized by the use of pointers (often physical disk addresses) to follow relationships from one record to another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe relational model, first proposed in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing applications, and as of 2018[update] they remain dominant: IBM Db2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server are the most searched DBMS.[9] The dominant database language, standardized SQL for the relational model, has influenced database languages for other data models.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObject databases were developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience of objectârelational impedance mismatch, which led to the coining of the term \"post-relational\" and also the development of hybrid objectârelational databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known as NoSQL databases, introducing fast keyâvalue stores and document-oriented databases. A competing \"next generation\" known as NewSQL databases attempted new implementations that retained the relational/SQL model while aiming to match the high performance of NoSQL compared to commercially available relational DBMSs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe introduction of the term database coincided with the availability of direct-access storage (disks and drums) from the mid-1960s onwards. The term represented a contrast with the tape-based systems of the past, allowing shared interactive use rather than daily batch processing. The Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1962 report by the System Development Corporation of California as the first to use the term \"data-base\" in a specific technical sense.[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs computers grew in speed and capability, a number of general-purpose database systems emerged; by the mid-1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use. Interest in a standard began to grow, and Charles Bachman, author of one such product, the Integrated Data Store (IDS), founded the Database Task Group within CODASYL, the group responsible for the creation and standardization of COBOL. In 1971, the Database Task Group delivered their standard, which generally became known as the CODASYL approach, and soon a number of commercial products based on this approach entered the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CODASYL approach offered applications the ability to navigate around a linked data set which was formed into a large network. Applications could find records by one of three methods:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater systems added B-trees to provide alternate access paths. Many CODASYL databases also added a declarative query language for end users (as distinct from the navigational API). However, CODASYL databases were complex and required significant training and effort to produce useful applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIBM also had its own DBMS in 1966, known as Information Management System (IMS). IMS was a development of software written for the Apollo program on the System/360. IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL, but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL\u0027s network model. Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed: the term was popularized by Bachman\u0027s 1973 Turing Award presentation The Programmer as Navigator. IMS is classified by IBM as a hierarchical database. IDMS and Cincom Systems\u0027 TOTAL[broken anchor] databases are classified as network databases. IMS remains in use as of 2014[update].[11]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgar F. Codd worked at IBM in San Jose, California, in one of their offshoot offices that were primarily involved in the development of hard disk systems. He was unhappy with the navigational model of the CODASYL approach, notably the lack of a \"search\" facility. In 1970, he wrote a number of papers that outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in the groundbreaking A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.[12]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this paper, he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd\u0027s idea was to organize the data as a number of \"tables\", each table being used for a different type of entity. Each table would contain a fixed number of columns containing the attributes of the entity. One or more columns of each table were designated as a primary key by which the rows of the table could be uniquely identified; cross-references between tables always used these primary keys, rather than disk addresses, and queries would join tables based on these key relationships, using a set of operations based on the mathematical system of relational calculus (from which the model takes its name). Splitting the data into a set of normalized tables (or relations) aimed to ensure that each \"fact\" was only stored once, thus simplifying update operations. Virtual tables called views could present the data in different ways for different users, but views could not be directly updated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCodd used mathematical terms to define the model: relations, tuples, and domains rather than tables, rows, and columns. The terminology that is now familiar came from early implementations. Codd would later criticize the tendency for practical implementations to depart from the mathematical foundations on which the model was based.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of primary keys (user-oriented identifiers) to represent cross-table relationships, rather than disk addresses, had two primary motivations. From an engineering perspective, it enabled tables to be relocated and resized without expensive database reorganization. But Codd was more interested in the difference in semantics: the use of explicit identifiers made it easier to define update operations with clean mathematical definitions, and it also enabled query operations to be defined in terms of the established discipline of first-order predicate calculus; because these operations have clean mathematical properties, it becomes possible to rewrite queries in provably correct ways, which is the basis of query optimization. There is no loss of expressiveness compared with the hierarchic or network models, though the connections between tables are no longer so explicit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hierarchic and network models, records were allowed to have a complex internal structure. For example, the salary history of an employee might be represented as a \"repeating group\" within the employee record. In the relational model, the process of normalization led to such internal structures being replaced by data held in multiple tables, connected only by logical keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, a common use of a database system is to track information about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers. In the navigational approach, all of this data would be placed in a single variable-length record. In the relational approach, the data would be normalized into a user table, an address table and a phone number table (for instance). Records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as identifying rows/records using logical identifiers rather than disk addresses, Codd changed the way in which applications assembled data from multiple records. Rather than requiring applications to gather data one record at a time by navigating the links, they would use a declarative query language that expressed what data was required, rather than the access path by which it should be found. Finding an efficient access path to the data became the responsibility of the database management system, rather than the application programmer. This process, called query optimization, depended on the fact that queries were expressed in terms of mathematical logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCodd\u0027s paper was picked up by two people at Berkeley, Eugene Wong and Michael Stonebraker. They started a project known as INGRES using funding that had already been allocated for a geographical database project and student programmers to produce code. Beginning in 1973, INGRES delivered its first test products which were generally ready for widespread use in 1979. INGRES was similar to System R in a number of ways, including the use of a \"language\" for data access, known as QUEL. Over time, INGRES moved to the emerging SQL standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIBM itself did one test implementation of the relational model, PRTV, and a production one, Business System 12, both now discontinued. Honeywell wrote MRDS for Multics, and now there are two new implementations: Alphora Dataphor and Rel. Most other DBMS implementations usually called relational are actually SQL DBMSs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1970, the University of Michigan began development of the MICRO Information Management System[13] based on D.L. Childs\u0027 Set-Theoretic Data model.[14][15][16] MICRO was used to manage very large data sets by the US Department of Labor, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and researchers from the University of Alberta, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. It ran on IBM mainframe computers using the Michigan Terminal System.[17] The system remained in production until 1998.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made to build database systems with integrated hardware and software. The underlying philosophy was that such integration would provide higher performance at a lower cost. Examples were IBM System/38, the early offering of Teradata, and the Britton Lee, Inc. database machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother approach to hardware support for database management was ICL\u0027s CAFS accelerator, a hardware disk controller with programmable search capabilities. In the long term, these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers. Thus most database systems nowadays are software systems running on general-purpose hardware, using general-purpose computer data storage. However, this idea is still pursued in certain applications by some companies like Netezza and Oracle (Exadata).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIBM started working on a prototype system loosely based on Codd\u0027s concepts as System R in the early 1970s. The first version was ready in 1974/5, and work then started on multi-table systems in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record (some of which is optional) did not have to be stored in a single large \"chunk\". Subsequent multi-user versions were tested by customers in 1978 and 1979, by which time a standardized query language â SQL[citation needed] â had been added. Codd\u0027s ideas were establishing themselves as both workable and superior to CODASYL, pushing IBM to develop a true production version of System R, known as SQL/DS, and, later, Database 2 (IBM Db2).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarry Ellison\u0027s Oracle Database (or more simply, Oracle) started from a different chain, based on IBM\u0027s papers on System R. Though Oracle V1 implementations were completed in 1978, it was not until Oracle Version 2 when Ellison beat IBM to market in 1979.[18]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStonebraker went on to apply the lessons from INGRES to develop a new database, Postgres, which is now known as PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is often used for global mission-critical applications (the .org and .info domain name registries use it as their primary data store, as do many large companies and financial institutions).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Sweden, Codd\u0027s paper was also read and Mimer SQL was developed in the mid-1970s at Uppsala University. In 1984, this project was consolidated into an independent enterprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother data model, the entityârelationship model, emerged in 1976 and gained popularity for database design as it emphasized a more familiar description than the earlier relational model. Later on, entityârelationship constructs were retrofitted as a data modeling construct for the relational model, and the difference between the two has become irrelevant.[citation needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 1980s ushered in the age of desktop computing. The new computers empowered their users with spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3 and database software like dBASE. The dBASE product was lightweight and easy for any computer user to understand out of the box. C. Wayne Ratliff, the creator of dBASE, stated: \"dBASE was different from programs like BASIC, C, FORTRAN, and COBOL in that a lot of the dirty work had already been done. The data manipulation is done by dBASE instead of by the user, so the user can concentrate on what he is doing, rather than having to mess with the dirty details of opening, reading, and closing files, and managing space allocation.\"[19] dBASE was one of the top selling software titles in the 1980s and early 1990s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 1990s, along with a rise in object-oriented programming, saw a growth in how data in various databases were handled. Programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases as objects. That is to say that if a person\u0027s data were in a database, that person\u0027s attributes, such as their address, phone number, and age, were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data. This allows for relations between data to be related to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields.[20] The term \"objectârelational impedance mismatch\" described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables. Object databases and objectârelational databases attempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL. On the programming side, libraries known as objectârelational mappings (ORMs) attempt to solve the same problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXML databases are a type of structured document-oriented database that allows querying based on XML document attributes. XML databases are mostly used in applications where the data is conveniently viewed as a collection of documents, with a structure that can vary from the very flexible to the highly rigid: examples include scientific articles, patents, tax filings, and personnel records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoSQL databases are often very fast, do not require fixed table schemas, avoid join operations by storing denormalized data, and are designed to scale horizontally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, there has been a strong demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance, but according to the CAP theorem, it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency, availability, and partition tolerance guarantees. A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three. For that reason, many NoSQL databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewSQL is a class of modern relational databases that aims to provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (read-write) workloads while still using SQL and maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabases are used to support internal operations of organizations and to underpin online interactions with customers and suppliers (see Enterprise software).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabases are used to hold administrative information and more specialized data, such as engineering data or economic models. Examples include computerized library systems, flight reservation systems, computerized parts inventory systems, and many content management systems that store websites as collections of webpages in a database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne way to classify databases involves the type of their contents, for example: bibliographic, document-text, statistical, or multimedia objects. Another way is by their application area, for example: accounting, music compositions, movies, banking, manufacturing, or insurance. A third way is by some technical aspect, such as the database structure or interface type. This section lists a few of the adjectives used to characterize different kinds of databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnolly and Begg define database management system (DBMS) as a \"software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database.\"[24] Examples of DBMS\u0027s include MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and Microsoft Access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe DBMS acronym is sometimes extended to indicate the underlying database model, with RDBMS for the relational, OODBMS for the object (oriented) and ORDBMS for the objectârelational model. Other extensions can indicate some other characteristics, such as DDBMS for a distributed database management systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe functionality provided by a DBMS can vary enormously. The core functionality is the storage, retrieval and update of data. Codd proposed the following functions and services a fully-fledged general purpose DBMS should provide:[25]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also generally to be expected the DBMS will provide a set of utilities for such purposes as may be necessary to administer the database effectively, including import, export, monitoring, defragmentation and analysis utilities.[26] The core part of the DBMS interacting between the database and the application interface sometimes referred to as the database engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften DBMSs will have configuration parameters that can be statically and dynamically tuned, for example the maximum amount of main memory on a server the database can use. The trend is to minimize the amount of manual configuration, and for cases such as embedded databases the need to target zero-administration is paramount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large major enterprise DBMSs have tended to increase in size and functionality and have involved up to thousands of human years of development effort throughout their lifetime.[a]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly multi-user DBMS typically only allowed for the application to reside on the same computer with access via terminals or terminal emulation software. The clientâserver architecture was a development where the application resided on a client desktop and the database on a server allowing the processing to be distributed. This evolved into a multitier architecture incorporating application servers and web servers with the end user interface via a web browser with the database only directly connected to the adjacent tier.[28]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA general-purpose DBMS will provide public application programming interfaces (API) and optionally a processor for database languages such as SQL to allow applications to be written to interact with and manipulate the database. A special purpose DBMS may use a private API and be specifically customized and linked to a single application. For example, an email system performs many of the functions of a general-purpose DBMS such as message insertion, message deletion, attachment handling, blocklist lookup, associating messages an email address and so forth however these functions are limited to what is required to handle email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExternal interaction with the database will be via an application program that interfaces with the DBMS.[29] This can range from a database tool that allows users to execute SQL queries textually or graphically, to a website that happens to use a database to store and search information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA programmer will code interactions to the database (sometimes referred to as a datasource) via an application program interface (API) or via a database language. The particular API or language chosen will need to be supported by DBMS, possibly indirectly via a preprocessor or a bridging API. Some API\u0027s aim to be database independent, ODBC being a commonly known example. Other common API\u0027s include JDBC and ADO.NET.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as sublanguages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase languages are specific to a particular data model. Notable examples include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA database language may also incorporate features like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the internal (physical) level in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., metadata, \"data about the data\", and internal data structures) to reconstruct the conceptual level and external level from the internal level when needed. Databases as digital objects contain three layers of information which must be stored: the data, the structure, and the semantics. Proper storage of all three layers is needed for future preservation and longevity of the database.[33] Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the database engine a.k.a. \"storage engine\". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often using the operating systems\u0027 file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration settings are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look at the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels\u0027 reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome DBMSs support specifying which character encoding was used to store data, so multiple encodings can be used in the same database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarious low-level database storage structures are used by the storage engine to serialize the data model so it can be written to the medium of choice. Techniques such as indexing may be used to improve performance. Conventional storage is row-oriented, but there are also column-oriented and correlation databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften storage redundancy is employed to increase performance. A common example is storing materialized views, which consist of frequently needed external views or query results. Storing such views saves the expensive computing them each time they are needed. The downsides of materialized views are the overhead incurred when updating them to keep them synchronized with their original updated database data, and the cost of storage redundancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally a database employs storage redundancy by database objects replication (with one or more copies) to increase data availability (both to improve performance of simultaneous multiple end-user accesses to the same database object, and to provide resiliency in a case of partial failure of a distributed database). Updates of a replicated object need to be synchronized across the object copies. In many cases, the entire database is replicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith data virtualization, the data used remains in its original locations and real-time access is established to allow analytics across multiple sources. This can aid in resolving some technical difficulties such as compatibility problems when combining data from various platforms, lowering the risk of error caused by faulty data, and guaranteeing that the newest data is used. Furthermore, avoiding the creation of a new database containing personal information can make it easier to comply with privacy regulations. However, with data virtualization, the connection to all necessary data sources must be operational as there is no local copy of the data, which is one of the main drawbacks of the approach.[34]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase security deals with all various aspects of protecting the database content, its owners, and its users. It ranges from protection from intentional unauthorized database uses to unintentional database accesses by unauthorized entities (e.g., a person or a computer program).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase access control deals with controlling who (a person or a certain computer program) are allowed to access what information in the database. The information may comprise specific database objects (e.g., record types, specific records, data structures), certain computations over certain objects (e.g., query types, or specific queries), or using specific access paths to the former (e.g., using specific indexes or other data structures to access information). Database access controls are set by special authorized (by the database owner) personnel that uses dedicated protected security DBMS interfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may be managed directly on an individual basis, or by the assignment of individuals and privileges to groups, or (in the most elaborate models) through the assignment of individuals and groups to roles which are then granted entitlements. Data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database. Using passwords, users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called \"subschemas\". For example, an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee, but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data, while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data. If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for managing personal databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData security in general deals with protecting specific chunks of data, both physically (i.e., from corruption, or destruction, or removal; e.g., see physical security), or the interpretation of them, or parts of them to meaningful information (e.g., by looking at the strings of bits that they comprise, concluding specific valid credit-card numbers; e.g., see data encryption).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChange and access logging records who accessed which attributes, what was changed, and when it was changed. Logging services allow for a forensic database audit later by keeping a record of access occurrences and changes. Sometimes application-level code is used to record changes rather than leaving this in the database. Monitoring can be set up to attempt to detect security breaches. Therefore, organizations must take database security seriously because of the many benefits it provides. Organizations will be safeguarded from security breaches and hacking activities like firewall intrusion, virus spread, and ransom ware. This helps in protecting the company\u0027s essential information, which cannot be shared with outsiders at any cause.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase transactions can be used to introduce some level of fault tolerance and data integrity after recovery from a crash. A database transaction is a unit of work, typically encapsulating a number of operations over a database (e.g., reading a database object, writing, acquiring or releasing a lock, etc.), an abstraction supported in database and also other systems. Each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms of which program/code executions are included in that transaction (determined by the transaction\u0027s programmer via special transaction commands).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe acronym ACID describes some ideal properties of a database transaction: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA database built with one DBMS is not portable to another DBMS (i.e., the other DBMS cannot run it). However, in some situations, it is desirable to migrate a database from one DBMS to another. The reasons are primarily economical (different DBMSs may have different total costs of ownership or TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves the database\u0027s transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database\u0027s conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly (one-time) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate. This is in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically, a DBMS vendor provides tools to help import databases from other popular DBMSs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter designing a database for an application, the next stage is building the database. Typically, an appropriate general-purpose DBMS can be selected to be used for this purpose. A DBMS provides the needed user interfaces to be used by database administrators to define the needed application\u0027s data structures within the DBMS\u0027s respective data model. Other user interfaces are used to select needed DBMS parameters (like security related, storage allocation parameters, etc.).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the database is ready (all its data structures and other needed components are defined), it is typically populated with initial application\u0027s data (database initialization, which is typically a distinct project; in many cases using specialized DBMS interfaces that support bulk insertion) before making it operational. In some cases, the database becomes operational while empty of application data, and data are accumulated during its operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the database is created, initialized and populated it needs to be maintained. Various database parameters may need changing and the database may need to be tuned (tuning) for better performance; application\u0027s data structures may be changed or added, new related application programs may be written to add to the application\u0027s functionality, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database\u0027s data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are used to restore that state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatic analysis techniques for software verification can be applied also in the scenario of query languages. In particular, the *Abstract interpretation framework has been extended to the field of query languages for relational databases as a way to support sound approximation techniques.[36] The semantics of query languages can be tuned according to suitable abstractions of the concrete domain of data. The abstraction of relational database systems has many interesting applications, in particular, for security purposes, such as fine-grained access control, watermarking, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther DBMS features might include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncreasingly, there are calls for a single system that incorporates all of these core functionalities into the same build, test, and deployment framework for database management and source control. Borrowing from other developments in the software industry, some market such offerings as \"DevOps for database\".[37]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first task of a database designer is to produce a conceptual data model that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database. A common approach to this is to develop an entityârelationship model, often with the aid of drawing tools. Another popular approach is the Unified Modeling Language. A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organization, like \"can a customer also be a supplier?\", or \"if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?\", or \"if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?\". The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities (customers, products, flights, flight segments) and their relationships and attributes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProducing the conceptual data model sometimes involves input from business processes, or the analysis of workflow in the organization. This can help to establish what information is needed in the database, and what can be left out. For example, it can help when deciding whether the database needs to hold historic data as well as current data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with, the next stage is to translate this into a schema that implements the relevant data structures within the database. This process is often called logical database design, and the output is a logical data model expressed in the form of a schema. Whereas the conceptual data model is (in theory at least) independent of the choice of database technology, the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen DBMS. (The terms data model and database model are often used interchangeably, but in this article we use data model for the design of a specific database, and database model for the modeling notation used to express that design).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most popular database model for general-purpose databases is the relational model, or more precisely, the relational model as represented by the SQL language. The process of creating a logical database design using this model uses a methodical approach known as normalization. The goal of normalization is to ensure that each elementary \"fact\" is only recorded in one place, so that insertions, updates, and deletions automatically maintain consistency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like, which depend on the particular DBMS. This is often called physical database design, and the output is the physical data model. A key goal during this stage is data independence, meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are two types of data independence: Physical data independence and logical data independence. Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother aspect of physical database design is security. It involves both defining access control to database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized, and manipulated. The most popular example of a database model is the relational model (or the SQL approximation of relational), which uses a table-based format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommon logical data models for databases include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn objectârelational database combines the two related structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhysical data models include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther models include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecialized models are optimized for particular types of data:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA database management system provides three views of the database data:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there is typically only one conceptual and internal view of the data, there can be any number of different external views. This allows users to see database information in a more business-related way rather than from a technical, processing viewpoint. For example, a financial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the company\u0027s expenses, but does not need details about employees that are in the interest of the human resources department. Thus different departments need different views of the company\u0027s database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three-level database architecture relates to the concept of data independence which was one of the major initial driving forces of the relational model.[39] The idea is that changes made at a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level. For example, changes in the internal level do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces, which reduces the impact of making physical changes to improve performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On the one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s, both in academia and in the research and development groups of companies (for example IBM Research). Research activity includes theory and development of prototypes. Notable research topics have included models, the atomic transaction concept, related concurrency control techniques, query languages and query optimization methods, RAID, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe database research area has several dedicated academic journals (for example, ACM Transactions on Database Systems-TODS, Data and Knowledge Engineering-DKE) and annual conferences (e.g., ACM SIGMOD, ACM PODS, VLDB, IEEE ICDE).\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://pub.dev/","html":"\u003cp\u003eThe official package repository for Dart and Flutter apps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the packages that demonstrate the highest levels of quality, selected by the Flutter Ecosystem Committee\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA declarative router for Flutter based on Navigation 2 supporting deep linking, data-driven routes and more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wrapper around InheritedWidget to make them easier to use and more reusable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beautiful and animated bottom navigation.

Databases are structured to facilitate the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in conjunction with various data-processing operations. A database management system (DBMS) extracts information from the database in response to queries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brief treatment of databases follows. For full treatment, see computer science: Information systems and databases; information processing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA database is stored as a file or a set of files. The information in these files may be broken down into records, each of which consists of one or more fields. Fields are the basic units of data storage, and each field typically contains information pertaining to one aspect or attribute of the entity described by the database. Records are also organized into tables that include information about relationships between its various fields. Although database is applied loosely to any collection of information in computer files, a database in the strict sense provides cross-referencing capabilities. Using keywords and various sorting commands, users can rapidly search, rearrange, group, and select the fields in many records to retrieve or create reports on particular aggregates of data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDatabase records and files must be organized to allow retrieval of the information. Queries are the main way users retrieve database information. The power of a DBMS comes from its ability to define new relationships from the basic ones given by the tables and to use them to get responses to queries. Typically, the user provides a string of characters, and the computer searches the database for a corresponding sequence and provides the source materials in which those characters appear; a user can request, for example, all records in which the contents of the field for a personâs last name is the word Smith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe many users of a large database must be able to manipulate the information within it quickly at any given time. Moreover, large business and other organizations tend to build up many independent files containing related and even overlapping data, and their data-processing activities often require the linking of data from several files. Several different types of DBMS have been developed to support these requirements: flat, hierarchical, network, relational, and object-oriented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly systems were arranged sequentially (i.e., alphabetically, numerically, or chronologically); the development of direct-access storage devices made possible random access to data via indexes. In flat databases, records are organized according to a simple list of entities; many simple databases for personal computers are flat in structure. The records in hierarchical databases are organized in a treelike structure, with each level of records branching off into a set of smaller categories. Unlike hierarchical databases, which provide single links between sets of records at different levels, network databases create multiple linkages between sets by placing links, or pointers, to one set of records in another; the speed and versatility of network databases have led to their wide use within businesses and in e-commerce. Relational databases are used where associations between files or records cannot be expressed by links; a simple flat list becomes one row of a table, or ârelation,â and multiple relations can be mathematically associated to yield desired information. Various iterations of SQL (Structured Query Language) are widely employed in DBMS for relational databases. Object-oriented databases store and manipulate more complex data structures, called âobjects,â which are organized into hierarchical classes that may inherit properties from classes higher in the chain; this database structure is the most flexible and adaptable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe information in many databases consists of natural-language texts of documents; number-oriented databases primarily contain information such as statistics, tables, financial data, and raw scientific and technical data. Small databases can be maintained on personal-computer systems and used by individuals at home. These and larger databases have become increasingly important in business life, in part because they are now commonly designed to be integrated with other office software, including spreadsheet programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical commercial database applications include airline reservations, production management functions, medical records in hospitals, and legal records of insurance companies. The largest databases are usually maintained by governmental agencies, business organizations, and universities. These databases may contain texts of such materials as abstracts, reports, legal statutes, wire services, newspapers and journals, encyclopaedias, and catalogs of various kinds. Reference databases contain bibliographies or indexes that serve as guides to the location of information in books, periodicals, and other published literature. Thousands of these publicly accessible databases now exist, covering topics ranging from law, medicine, and engineering to news and current events, games, classified advertisements, and instructional courses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncreasingly, formerly separate databases are being combined electronically into larger collections known as data warehouses. Businesses and government agencies then employ âdata miningâ software to analyze multiple aspects of the data for various patterns. For example, a government agency might flag for human investigation a company or individual that purchased a suspicious quantity of certain equipment or materials, even though the purchases were spread around the country or through various subsidiaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp","html":"\u003cp\u003eW3Schools offers a wide range of services and products for beginners and professionals, helping millions of people everyday to learn and master new skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoy our free tutorials like millions of other internet users since 1999\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplore our selection of references covering all popular coding languages\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate your own website with W3Schools Spaces - no setup required\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTest your skills with different exercises\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTest yourself with multiple choice questions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDocument your knowledge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate a free W3Schools Account to Improve Your Learning Experience\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrack your learning progress at W3Schools and collect rewards\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecome a PLUS user and unlock powerful features (ad-free, hosting, support,..)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot sure where you want to start?

Either way, most agree that NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoSQL databases emerged in the late 2000s as the cost of storage dramatically decreased. Gone were the days of needing to create a complex, difficult-to-manage data model in order to avoid data duplication. Developers (rather than storage) were becoming the primary cost of software development, so NoSQL databases optimized for developer productivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs storage costs rapidly decreased, the amount of data that applications needed to store and query increased. This data came in all shapes and sizes â structured, semi-structured, and polymorphic â and defining the schema in advance became nearly impossible. NoSQL databases allow developers to store huge amounts of unstructured data, giving them a lot of flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, the Agile Manifesto was rising in popularity, and software engineers were rethinking the way they developed software. They were recognizing the need to rapidly adapt to changing requirements. They needed the ability to iterate quickly and make changes throughout their software stack â all the way down to the database. NoSQL databases gave them this flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloud computing also rose in popularity, and developers began using public clouds to host their applications and data. They wanted the ability to distribute data across multiple servers and regions to make their applications resilient, to scale out instead of scale up, and to intelligently geo-place their data. Some NoSQL databases like MongoDB provide these capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach NoSQL database has its own unique features. At a high level, many NoSQL databases have the following features:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck out What are the Benefits of NoSQL Databases? to learn more about each of the features listed above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, four major types of NoSQL databases emerged: document databases, key-value databases, wide-column stores, and graph databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo learn more, visit Understanding the Different Types of NoSQL Databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a variety of differences exist between relational database management systems (RDBMS) and NoSQL databases, one of the key differences is the way the data is modeled in the database. In this section, we\u0027ll work through an example of modeling the same data in a relational database and a NoSQL database. Then, we\u0027ll highlight some of the other key differences between relational databases and NoSQL databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s consider an example of storing information about a user and their hobbies. We need to store a user\u0027s first name, last name, cell phone number, city, and hobbies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a relational database, we\u0027d likely create two tables: one for Users and one for Hobbies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHobbies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to retrieve all of the information about a user and their hobbies, information from the Users table and Hobbies table will need to be joined together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe data model we design for a NoSQL database will depend on the type of NoSQL database we choose. Let\u0027s consider how to store the same information about a user and their hobbies in a document database like MongoDB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to retrieve all of the information about a user and their hobbies, a single document can be retrieved from the database. No joins are required, resulting in faster queries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo see a more detailed version of this data modeling example, read Mapping Terms and Concepts from SQL to MongoDB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the example above highlights the differences in data models between relational databases and NoSQL databases, many other important differences exist, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo learn more about the differences between relational databases and NoSQL databases, visit NoSQL vs SQL Databases, or watch From RDBMS to NoSQL presentation from AWs re:Invent 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoSQL databases are used in nearly every industry. Use cases range from the highly critical (e.g., storing financial data and healthcare records) to the more fun and frivolous (e.g., storing IoT readings from a smart kitty litter box).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the following sections, we\u0027ll explore when you should choose to use a NoSQL database and common misconceptions about NoSQL databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen deciding which database to use, decision-makers typically find one or more of the following factors lead them to selecting a NoSQL database:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee When to Use NoSQL Databases and Exploring NoSQL Database Examples for more detailed information on the reasons listed above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, many misconceptions about NoSQL databases have spread throughout the developer community. In this section, we\u0027ll discuss two of the most common misconceptions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo learn more about common misconceptions, read Everything You Know About MongoDB is Wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA common misconception is that NoSQL databases or non-relational databases donât store relationship data well. NoSQL databases can store relationship data â they just store it differently than relational databases do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, when compared with relational databases, many find modeling relationship data in NoSQL databases to be easier than in relational databases, because related data doesnât have to be split between tables. NoSQL data models allow related data to be nested within a single data structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother common misconception is that NoSQL databases don\u0027t support ACID transactions. Some NoSQL databases like MongoDB do, in fact, support ACID transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that the way data is modeled in NoSQL databases can eliminate the need for multi-record transactions in many use cases. Consider the earlier example where we stored information about a user and their hobbies in both a relational database and a document database. In order to ensure information about a user and their hobbies was updated together in a relational database, we\u0027d need to use a transaction to update records in two tables. In order to do the same in a document database, we could update a single document â no multi-record transaction required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA variety of NoSQL databases exist. Today, we\u0027ll be trying MongoDB, the world\u0027s most popular NoSQL database according to DB-Engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this tutorial, you\u0027ll load a sample database and learn to query it â all without installing anything on your computer or paying anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe easiest way to get started with MongoDB is MongoDB Atlas. Atlas is MongoDB\u0027s fully managed database-as-a-service. Atlas has a forever free tier, which is what you\u0027ll be using today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information on how to complete the steps above, visit the official MongoDB documentation on creating an Atlas account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cluster is a place where you can store your MongoDB databases. In this section, you\u0027ll create a free cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have a cluster, you can begin storing data in Atlas. You could choose to manually create a database in the Atlas Data Explorer, in the MongoDB Shell, in MongoDB Compass, or using your favorite programming language. Instead, in this example, you will import Atlas\u0027s sample dataset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoading the sample dataset will take several minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we don\u0027t need to think about database design for this tutorial, note that database design and data modeling are major factors in MongoDB performance. Learn more about best practices for modeling data in MongoDB:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you have data in your cluster, let\u0027s query it! Just like you had multiple ways to create a database, you have multiple options for querying a database: in the Atlas Data Explorer, in the MongoDB Shell, in MongoDB Compass, or using your favorite programming language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this section, youâll query the database using the Atlas Data Explorer. This is a good way to get started querying, as it requires zero setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo documents with the title âPride and Prejudiceâ are returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCongrats! You\u0027ve successfully queried a NoSQL database!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this tutorial, we only scratched the surface of what you can do in MongoDB and Atlas. Continue interacting with your data by using the Data Explorer to insert new documents, edit existing documents, and delete documents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you are ready to try more advanced queries that aggregate your data, create an aggregation pipeline. The aggregation framework is an incredibly powerful tool for analyzing your data. To learn more, take the free MongoDB University Course M121 The MongoDB Aggregation Framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you want to visualize your data, check out MongoDB Charts. Charts is the easiest way to visualize data stored in Atlas and Atlas Data Lake. Charts allows you to create dashboards that are filled with visualizations of your data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoSQL databases provide a variety of benefits including flexible data models, horizontal scaling, lightning fast queries, and ease of use for developers. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types including document databases, key-values databases, wide-column stores, and graph databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMongoDB is the world\u0027s most popular NoSQL database. Learn more about MongoDB Atlas, and give the free tier a try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcited to learn more now that you have your own Atlas account? Head over to MongoDB University where you can get free online training from MongoDB engineers and earn a MongoDB certification. The Quick Start Tutorials are another great place to begin; they will get you up and running quickly with your favorite programming language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany NoSQL databases have the following advantages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck out What are the Benefits of NoSQL Databases? for more details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoSQL databases are used in nearly every industry for a variety of use cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe type of NoSQL database determines the typical use case. For example, document databases like MongoDB are general purpose databases. Key-value databases are ideal for large volumes of data with simple lookup queries. Wide-column stores work well for use cases with large amounts of data and predictable query patterns. Graph databases excel at analyzing and traversing relationships between data. See Understanding the Different Types of NoSQL Databases for more information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, NoSQL databases are not hard to learn. In fact, many developers find modeling data in NoSQL databases to be incredibly intuitive. For example, documents in MongoDB map to data structures in most popular programming languages, making programming faster and easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that those with training and experience in relational databases will likely face a bit of a learning curve as they adjust to new ways of modeling data in NoSQL databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article was written by Lauren Schaefer, a MongoDB Developer Advocate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn more about key differences between NoSQL vs SQL Databases\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupport\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-learning-guide/","html":"Couldn\u0027t Connect"},{"url":"https://developers.google.com/learn/topics/go","html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo is an open source, strongly typed, compiled language written to build concurrent and scalable software.

The stage uses x and y coordinates, with 0,0 being the stage center.[13]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sprite selected at the bottom of the staging area, blocks of commands can be applied to it by dragging them from the block palette into the coding area. The Costumes tab allows users to change the look of the sprite with a vector and bitmap editor in order to create various effects, including animation.[13] The Sounds tab allows attaching sounds and music to a sprite.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen creating sprites and also backgrounds, users can draw their own sprite manually,[13] choose a Sprite from the library, or upload an image.[14]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe table below shows the categories of the programming blocks:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn offline \"Desktop Editor\" for Scratch 3.0 is available for Microsoft Windows 10 and above in the Microsoft Store, Apple\u0027s macOS, ChromeOS, and Android;[15] this allows the creation and playing of Scratch programs offline. The offline editor can also be downloaded in previous versions, such as Scratch 2.0 and Scratch 1.4 (an archive of older versions is found here).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Scratch, extensions add extra blocks and features that can be used in projects. In Scratch 2.0, the extensions were all hardware-based. Software-based extensions were added in Scratch 3.0, such as text-to-speech voices, along with some new hardware-based extensions like the micro:bit. The extensions are listed below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the digital extensions in Scratch 3.0 used to be regular block categories that were moved to the extensions section to reduce clutter. These include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew digital extensions have also been added in collaborations with commercial companies. These include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA paper published in 2019 by NYU argues and illustrates, for coding music with Scratch, \"that the music and sound blocks as currently implemented in Scratch may limit and frustrate meaningful music-making for children, the core user base for Scratch.\"[16]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Scratch Lab[17] displays experiments from the Scratch Team, intended to explore whether new features may be added to the full website in the future. Experimental features currently under development include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch is used in many different settings: schools, museums, libraries, community centers, and homes.[18][19][11] Scratch is designed primarily for users aged 8â16, but it is used by all ages and has a sizeable adult user base as of 2009.[8][20] This wide outreach has created many surrounding communities, both physical and digital.[10] In April 2020, the Tiobe ranking of the world\u0027s programming languages included Scratch in the top 20. According to Tiobe, there are 50 million projects written in Scratch, and every month one million new projects are added.[21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch is used as the introductory language because the creation of interesting programs is relatively easy, and skills learned can be applied to other programming languages such as Python and Java.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch is not exclusively for creating games. With the provided visuals, programmers can create animations, text, stories, music, and more. There are already many programs that students can use to learn topics in math, history, and even photography. Scratch allows teachers to create conceptual and visual lessons and science lab assignments with animations that help visualize difficult concepts. Within the social sciences, instructors can create quizzes, games, and tutorials with interactive elements. Using Scratch allows young people to understand the logic of programming and how to creatively build and collaborate.[22]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch is taught to more than 800 schools and 70 colleges of DAV organization in India and across the world.[23][24]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn higher education, Scratch is used in the first week of Harvard University\u0027s CS50 introductory computer science course.[25][26]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsers of Scratch are called \"Scratchers\". Scratchers have the capability to share their projects and get feedback. Projects can be uploaded directly from the development environment to the Scratch website and any member of the community can view and download the full source code to study or to remix into new projects.[27][28] Scratchers can also create project studios, comment, favorite, and \"love\" others\u0027 projects, follow other members to see their projects and activity, and share ideas. Projects range from games and animations to practical tools. Additionally, to encourage the creation and sharing amongst users, the website frequently establishes \"Scratch Design Studio\" challenges.[29]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MIT Scratch Team works to ensure that this community maintains a friendly and respectful environment for all people.[30][31]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEducators have their own online community called ScratchEd, developed and supported by the Harvard Graduate School of Education. In this community, Scratch educators share stories, exchange resources, and ask questions.[32]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Scratch Wiki is a support resource for Scratch and information about its website, history, and phenomena surrounding it. Although supported by the Scratch Team (the developers of Scratch), it is primarily written by Scratch users (Scratchers) and is hosted independently of the main Scratch website.[33] There are other wikis in languages besides English available on the Scratch Wiki base domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoles are displayed as a label under a user\u0027s username on profile pages and on forum posts. To prevent vandalism, new accounts have the \"New Scratcher\" role, as opposed by the usual \"Scratcher\" role. Some restrictions are imposed onto New Scratcher accounts, including the inability to use cloud data and a minimum 30 second cooldown period between posting comments.[34] After a period of time of interacting and creating projects, an account will be eligible to gain the Scratcher role.[35]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficial moderators and developers of Scratch are labeled as part of the \"Scratch Team\" and usually have an asterisk at the end of their username.[36] The site also has special types of accounts for Students and Educators to use Scratch in the classroom.[37]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn August 2020, GreatFire announced that the Chinese government had blocked access to the Scratch website. At the time, it was estimated that more than three million people in China were using it.[38][citation needed] The outlet cited the fact that Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan were listed as countries on the website.[38][39]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe source code for the project editor in all three major versions, as well as a majority of the current website, is hosted publicly on GitHub across various repositores.[40] Scratch 3.0 is JavaScript-based, 2.0 is programmed in ActionScript,[4] and the 1.x versions were based on Squeak, which itself is based on Smalltalk-80.[41]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2.0 had an experimental JavaScript-based interpreter that was being developed in parallel with the ActionScript version.[42]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 3.0, Scratch blocks are implemented using Blockly, a JavaScript library developed by Google for creating block-based visual programming languages.[43][44]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn 13 May 2014, a year after the release of Scratch 2.0, it was announced by a developer on the Scratch Forums that 2.0 would become open source.[45]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch Educators can gather in person at Scratch Educator Meetups. At these gatherings, Scratch Educators learn from each other and share ideas and strategies that support computational creativity.[46]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn annual \"Scratch Week\", formerly known as \"Scratch Day\", is declared in May each year. Community members are encouraged to host an event on or around this day, large or small, that celebrates Scratch. These events are held worldwide, and a listing can be found on the Scratch Day website. Scratch Week is a series focusing on Scratch activities on the Scratch website.[47]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery April Fools\u0027 Day, the Scratch Team will play pranks on users and add Easter eggs, one example being that all event blocks in projects turn into cat versions of the same blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the early 2000s, the MIT Media Lab\u0027s Lifelong Kindergarten group (LLK) was developing visual programming languages targeted towards children.[48] In 2003, Mitchel Resnick, Yasmin Kafai, and John Maeda were awarded a National Science Foundation grant for the development of a new programming environment for children to express themselves with code.[9] The LLK, led by Mitchel Resnick, in partnership with Yasmin Kafai\u0027s team at UCLA worked closely with Computer Clubhouses in Boston and Los Angeles to develop Scratch, grounding its design in the practices and social dynamics of these after-school youth centers.[9] It started as a basic programming language, with no labeled categories and no green flag.[49] Similar to AgentSheets[50] Scratch employed concepts of Tactile Programming later known as blocks-based programming. Scratch was made with the intention to teach kids to program.[49]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe philosophy of Scratch encourages the sharing, reuse, and combination of code, as indicated by the team slogan, \"Imagine, Program, Share\".[51] Users can make their own projects, or they may choose to \"remix\" someone else\u0027s project. Projects created and remixed with Scratch are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License.[52] Scratch automatically gives credit to the user who created the original project and program in the top part of the project page.[11]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch was developed based on ongoing interaction with youth and staff at Computer Clubhouses. The use of Scratch at Computer Clubhouses served as a model for other after-school centers demonstrating how informal learning settings can support the development of technological fluency.[53]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch 2.0 was released on 9 May 2013.[13] The update changed the look of the site and included both an online project editor and an offline editor.[54] Custom blocks could now be defined within projects, along with several other improvements.[55] The Scratch 2.0 Offline editor could be downloaded for Windows, Mac, and Linux directly from Scratch\u0027s website, although support for Linux was later dropped. The unofficial mobile version had to be downloaded from the Scratch forums.[56][57]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch 3.0 was first announced by the Scratch Team in 2016. Several public alpha versions were released between then and January 2018, after which the pre-beta \"Preview\" versions were released.[58] A beta version of Scratch 3.0 was released on 1 August 2018.[59] for use on most browsers; with the notable exception of Internet Explorer.[60]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch 3.0, the first 3.x release version, was released on 2 January 2019.[61] On 28 June 2023,[62] the header and links on the Scratch Website changed from blue to purple, and new optional high-contrast block colors were introduced, to make the site easier for colorblind people to read and use.[63]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Scratch 1.4, an *.sb file was the file format used to store projects.[64]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn *.sb file is divided into four sections:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch 2.0 uses the *.sb2 file format. These are zip files containing a .json file as well as the contents of the Scratch project including sounds (stored as .wav) and images (stored as .png).[67] Each filetype, excluding the project.json, is stored as a number, starting at 0 and counting up with each additional file. The image file labeled \"0.png\" is always a 480x360 white image, but \"0.wav\" will still be the earliest non-deleted file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ScratchX experimental version of Scratch used the .sbx file format.[68]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch 3.0 uses the *.sb3 format, which is very similar to *.sb2, one difference being the sound.[69]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the main Scratch website now runs only the current version (Scratch 3.0), the offline editors for Scratch 2.0 (and the earlier Scratch 1.4) are still available for download[70] and can be used to create and run games locally.[71] It is still possible to upload projects from the Scratch 2.0 launcher, which are immediately converted into Scratch 3.0 when uploaded to the main site.[72] There is also an offline version of Scratch 3.0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe editor of Scratch 1.4 and below was written in Squeak, while its online project viewer was written in Java, and a player written in Adobe Flash was later added.[41][73] Scratch 2.0 relied on Adobe Flash for the online version, and Adobe AIR for the offline editor. These have fallen out of favor, and Adobe dropped support for them at the end of 2020.[74][75]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Scratch 2.0, the stage area is on the left side, with the programming blocks palette in the middle, and the coding area on the right. Extensions are in the \"More Blocks\" section of the palette.[20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe web version of Scratch 2.0 introduced project autosaving.[76]:â23â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blocks palette in Scratch 2.0 is made of discrete sections that are not scrollable from one to the next; the table below shows the different sections:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch 2.0 introduced the backpack, which can be used to transfer scripts, sprites, costumes, and sounds between projects.[76]:â14â15â\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch 2.0 changed how sounds were imported, so many Scratch 1.4 sounds stopped working. (The project file was changed from *.sb to *.sb2).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch uses event-driven programming with multiple active objects called sprites.[13] Sprites can be drawn, as vector or bitmap graphics, from scratch in a simple editor that is part of Scratch, or can be imported from external sources. Scratch 3.0 only supports one-dimensional arrays, known as \"lists\", and floating-point scalars and strings are supported but with limited string manipulation ability. There is a strong contrast between the powerful multimedia functions and multi-threaded programming style and the rather limited scope of the Scratch programming language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch 2.0 does not treat procedures as first class structures and has limited file I/O options with Scratch 2.0 Extension Protocol, an experimental extension feature that allows interaction between Scratch 2.0 and other programs.[77] The Extension protocol allows interfacing with hardware boards such as Lego Mindstorms[78] or Arduino.[79]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA more advanced visual programming language inspired by Scratch is Snap!, featuring first class procedures (their mathematical foundations are called also lambda calculus), first-class lists (including lists of lists), and first-class truly object-oriented sprites with prototyping inheritance, and nestable sprites, which are not part of Scratch.[80] Snap! (previously \"BYOB\") was developed by Jens MÃ¶nig[81][82] with documentation provided by Brian Harvey[83][84] from University of California, Berkeley and has been used to teach \"The Beauty and Joy of Computing\" introductory course in CS for non-CS-major students.[85] Both of them were members of the Scratch Team before designing \"Snap!\".[86][20]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July 2014, ScratchJr was released for iPad, and in 2016, ScratchJr for Android. Although heavily inspired by Scratch and co-led by Mitch Resnick, it is nonetheless a complete rewrite designed for younger childrenâtargeting ages 5 through 7.[87]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the open source nature of Scratch, numerous forks and browser extensions have been created by the community that aim to improve or modify the user experience. Scratch Addons is one such browser extension that adds a multitude of toggleable themes and quality of life features to both the online editor and website.[88]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurboWarp is a fork of the Scratch 3.0 editor that compiles the Scratch blocks into JavaScript code when a project is run, meaning projects can run up to 200x faster, with results varying heavily depending on the project.[89][90] TurboWarp can also export projects to standalone HTML5, Android apps, Bundle (macOS) and EXE files.[91]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsers can also create their own extensions for Scratch 3.0 using JavaScript.[92] Although the intention for Scratch 3.0 was to allow unofficial JavaScript extensions to be developed by users, it was abandoned due to moderation risks. As a result, the official site doesn\u0027t allow JavaScript extensions to be added, but several modifications of the Scratch Engine do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore 2.0, a number of Scratch forks[93][better source needed] were created using the source code of Scratch 1.4. These programs usually only included a few extra blocks not present in Scratch.[94][better source needed]\u003c/p\u003e\n"}]
